Summary of this project:
1. DFS has its two implementation: one with recursion, the other is without recursion
but using stack.
2. BFS can be achieved by means of queue.
3. UCS alwasy expands the nodes with least *path cost* under current
situation.

Q7: find a heuristic for eating all the dots
1. use the count of existing food: 12500-node expansion
2. use the maze distance to the closest food: fail, run out of time
3.
