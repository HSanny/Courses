A useful distinction for Computer Science education, found in a book on Technology for Teaching Languages:

.p
This book is one of the first to consider the design and role of technology mediated
tasks in language learning and teaching... [the
foreword and contents make it clear that TBLT is old ("emerged in the                                        
early to mid-1980s" p.4), it is the technology
enhancement that is the new aspect here].
Arising from dissatisfaction with communicative language teaching
(CLT), the increasing interest in task-based language teaching (TBLT)
indicates a shift towards more authentic forms of learning. TBLT is
concerned with a number of macro-tasks such as information gathering
and problem-solving as well as evaluative tasks, all of which are
increasingly available to today's learners via online and web-based technologies.
.p
The popularity of Web 2.0 technologies (blogs, wikis, social
networking sites, podcasting, virtual worlds), as well as practical
applications of mobile learning, place a fresh emphasis on creating
project-orientated language learning tasks with a clear real-world
significance for learners of foreign languages.
...
and so on.
