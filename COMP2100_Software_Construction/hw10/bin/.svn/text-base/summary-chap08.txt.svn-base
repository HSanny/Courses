Code Documentation

Synthesis The application developed throughout this chapter is aimed at
generating customizable documentation for source code. The format chosen
for the documentation is HTML. The architecture of the application mainly
addresses extensibility requirements. Focus: this case study exemplifies
the application of the “Composite” design pattern which is widely used
when representation of hierarchical structure is required. OO techniques:
separation of concerns and delegation. Java features: A graphical user
interface is developed to provide ease of use for the application. The
GUI is developed by means of the swing set of components; in particular
a component is used, which is able to render HTML code. Background:
The reader is required to know the basic OO concepts and fundamental
Java programming techniques and to have a basic knowledge of HTML.
