Class Review 
-----------

###lecture03
1.  Time and space complexity for the DFS and BFS
2.  Difference between UCS and Greedy search.

###lecture04
1. Proof of A\* optimality
2. [DONE] dominance of heuristics

###lecture05
1. local beam search
2. gradient reinforcement learning
3. [DONE] concepts of **depth**

###lecture06
1. Review question: local search method equivalence
2. risk averse and risk prone
3. [disregard] backgammon game

###lecture10 and lecture11
1. proof of convergence in the MDP-version tree search
2. compute the value iteration and policy iteration
