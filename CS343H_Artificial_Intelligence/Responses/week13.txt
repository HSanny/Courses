Email response: respond to the CACM article linked above following the syllabus guidelines.

=========================================================================

This articile illustrates us a deformable model that represent objects using
local part templates and geometric constraints on the locations of parts. This
system reduces object detection problem to classification with latent
variables. Deformable models such as pictorial structures can capture
significant variations in appearance but a single deformable model still
cannot represent many interesting object categories. 

However, it is hard to train deformable part models because of the difficulty
of obtaining training data with part annotations.
Besides, the false prediction of this approach mainly comes from the
similarities among objects in different categories. Another reason for false
detections are due to the relatively strict bounding box overlap criteria. 

In the result section, the recalls and precisions of this approach with various
parameters are presented. It can be seen from the indicated result that the
use of parts can significantly improve the detection accuracy.
