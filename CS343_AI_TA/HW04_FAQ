1. What is the meaning of "Move"?
A: Move contains a combo of two actions: pick up and put down. 



2.  Do we need to support a boundless number of "and" statements, or just one?

A: Yes, your agents are supposed to parse the "and" compound statement as many
as possible. 



3. This is somewhat of a minor implementation detail, but what should our
parser actually output (to the agent as commands, not to the user) in the case
that the input command is malformed? Nothing?

A: The expected output is the agents' recognition and then execution of actions. 
For the logging, nothing is expected. 
But the recommended implementation is to output the sequence of recognized rules



4. Should "it" be recognized on different non-compound statements? As in, I
take it it should work with this example: 

    move disk1 from pole1 to pole2 and move it from pole2 to pole3

But should it work with multiple commands: 

    move disk1 from pole1 to pole2 
    move it from pole2 to pole3 

A: Good question. I think you do not have to implement "it" for multiple
commands. But you need to deal with it within one command for simplicity.
