1. Agents keep disappearing and respawing during training?  Is this a bug or
how its supposed to work? How do I make sure they don't keep disappearing?

A: This is what robots are supposed to work in the training stage. 
The position reset indicates a new episode of neuroevolution starts. 



2. What is the goal of the tournament?  Are our robots supposed to get to the
flag or kill all of the other team or something else?

A: In the tournament, your robots are supposed to trigger more damages than
your opponents' team. 



3. Will the environment for the the tournament be the default sandbox map we
start with, or is there going to be a set map/random maps each time?

A: The same sandbox map as what we did in the assignment.



4. How exactly are we supposed to pick and choose the individuals we want for
our team?

A: You copy the entire genome I believe, that worked for me anyway. As in from
the genomestart # ... genomeend # for all the individuals you want.



5. I ran into the bug mentioned at the bottom of the assignment description.
However, the instructions provided did not fix the issue. Logging out and
logging back in didn't help either.
I think it happened when I clicked the "new neuroevolution team" button when
the simulation was already running. OpenNERO crashed, and then when I tried to
reopen the training, it started giving me the error.

A: It sounds like a OpenNERO process is still running. Logging out and back in
doesn't seem to help but you should be able to find and kill the offending
process via the task manager or the "PS" command.
