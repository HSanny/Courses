<H2>CS378 Assignment 1 </H2>

<P><B>Due:</B> Friday, Feb. 7 at class time;  bring a hard copy to
  class (send it electronically if you won't be in class).<P>

<B>Note you can work with one other student on this project.  Be sure
  to identify both members of the team and include a sentence
  explaining the contributions of each.</B><P>

The MegaWazoo Corporation is a large company that manufactures
specialized electronic components used in power systems, industrial
control systems, weapons systems, etc.  MegaWazoo is one of only two
companies supplying these vital components and does a good business
with the private sector and the government, including the military.
It is fair to say that MegaWazoo's products are vital components of
the critical infrastructure of the nation and disruption in
MegaWazoo's production could have serious consequences. <P>

The CEO of the company recently has become alarmed by all of the
media coverage regarding the potential for cyberattacks (and other
attacks) on U.S. critical infrastructure, but isn't totally convinced
that the threat is real.  He wonders if the security establishment
isn't exaggerating the situation to improve their market prospects.
He's interested in hiring someone to investigate this question and, if
needed, to write a comprehensive IA plan for the company to better
protect their resources from potential threats. <P>

As a private IA consultant, you'd love to get the job, but to do so
you have to write a proposal asking for the business and convincing
the company that you know your stuff.  Your task in this assignment is
to write <I>a section of that proposal</I> that:
<ol>
<li> states your position on the question of whether there is indeed a
  serious credible threat to the national infrastructure;
<li> particularizes that belief with respect to MegaWazoo's position
  as a large player in the industrial economy; and 
<li> justifies your position.
</ol>
Your justification can quote experts or cite recent events that
support your position.  Make sure that you provide citations
where appropriate.<P>

The goal of this proposal section is to convince the CEO that you
understand the breadth of IA threats the company might face as a key
actor in the nation's critical infrastructure, not that you have in
mind specific solutions.  That is, don't spell out solutions to any
challenges; just make the case either that the company has (or does
not have) reason to be concerned about the possibility of significant
cyberthreats.  After all, your immediate goal is to get the job so
that you can later suggest solutions.<P>

<b>Important note:</b> Don't write this as a letter pitching your
services or your qualifications.  Think of it as a section in a
position paper; this section assesses the reality of the threat,
particularly as regards this corporation.  Also remember that this is
not an entire proposal; you can imagine that other sections in your
proposal have introduced you and your qualifications.  Focus on the
risk assessment aspects of the problem.<P>

Aim for around 2-3 pages.  Organize things carefully.  Think things
through because you may be building on this assignment in subsequent
work.<P>

<h3>Grading Information:</h3> This and subsequent writing assignments
will be graded on the following criteria:
<ol>
<li> Did you do the assignment as specified?
<li> Did you give it adequate thought and care? 
<li> Is your argument well reasoned and supported by evidence?
<li> Is the document formatted reasonably?  (It's better short than
  padded.)
<li> Are references cited correctly?
<li> Is the writing style acceptable? 
</ol>

We're not grading on grammar or spelling, but you should make a
credible effort to write in a style worthy of a student at a top-tier
university.
