<H2>CS361C Assignment 2 </H2>

<P><B>Due:</B> Wednesday, February 19, 2014 at classtime<P>

Please submit a hard copy of this assignment in class.  If you can't
be in class that day, send an electronic copy to the TA.<P>

<B>Note you can work with one other student on this project.  Be sure
  to identify both members of the team and include a short paragraph
  explaining the contributions of each.</B>  There is no specific page
  limit; take as much space as you need to convey the information. You
  will be graded on the quality of your thought, not on your grammar
  or spelling. Nevertheless, you are expected to take care with those
  aspects.<P>

<B>The Assignment:</B> Imagine that your proposal from Assignment 1
was accepted and you have been hired by MegaWazoo Corp. (though the
nature of the organization doesn't really matter much) as an
information assurance consultant.  The company buys a variety of COTS
software applications from numerous sources. Some vendors are
questionable and some may even be controlled or influenced by parties
hostile to your mission.  One of your tasks is to put in place a
"networthiness" program for applications.  That is, before any
particular application is deployed on the agency network, it is your
task to certify that it is <I>adequately secure</I>.  Is it even
possible to know if it is absolutely secure?<P>

It is infeasible to imagine thoroughly examining the code of all such
applications; for many you may not even have the source code.  So you
need some automated tools to help with the task.  There are a large
number of tools available.  Visit <A
href="http://sectools.org">SecTools.org</A> for one list of the top
125 security tools.  This is an excellent source for information about
available tools. <P>

Your specific task for this assignment is to suggest a toolkit of 5
tools that your company should acquire from among the many possible
tools in this marketplace.  You should write a report to the agency's
IT manager to justify your selection. You should assume that your
reader will be technically literate but not an expert in security or
in these tools. Your report should have the following sections:

<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
<LI> Introduction: short description of the problem and what this
  report is intended to accomplish.<br><br>

<LI> Environment: describe (invent) the computing environment of your
  agency.  You can say, for example, that all of the computers are PCs
  running Windows or all use Linux or all are Macs, or some
  combination.  The environment you choose will definitely affect
  which tools are appropriate.  I suggest postulating the type of
  environment that you personally are most familiar with.  You clearly
  should not choose PC-specific tools if you say that the agency
  is a Linux shop.<br><br>

<LI> Explain your selection criteria: What factors do you consider
  important in making your tool selections.  Notice that the
  <tt>sectools.org</tt> website lists tools in various categories.  It
  wouldn't make much sense to choose five vulnerability scanners, or
  five packet sniffers, etc.  But there are more than five
  categories, so you'll have to select among them. Explain which
  categories you considered vital and why.  Also explain what you're
  looking for in specific tools.<br><br>

<LI> Tools chosen: Describe the five tools you have selected.  Briefly
  give the characteristics of each and the reason for your selecton of
  that tool.  List factors that would be important to the IT manager
  receiving your report: is the tool difficult to obtain? is it
  actively maintained? is there an associated cost? etc.  For each
  tool you select, I suggest you doublecheck the information on
  the <tt>sectools.org</tt> website from other sources to ensure it's
  current.<br><br>
  
<LI> Conclusion: List any observations about this exercise and whether
  you believe that the five tools you've chosen provide an adequately
  complete solution to the overall certification problem.
</OL>

<I>Note: you are not evaluating the security of the 5 tools; you're
evaluating their usefulness.  They will become part of your toolkit
for your networthiness assessments.</i><P>
