<H2>CS361C Assignment 4 </H2>

<P><B>Due:</B> a final draft of the paper is due Monday, March 24 at
class time.  Please have a paper copy available at that time.  <i>Notice that
Spring Break comes between now and then, so plan your time
carefully.</i><P>

Notice that it's a <i>draft</i> that is required on March 24, but it
should be a final draft.  My goal is to read the papers, give you
feedback and allow you to submit a revision later if there are
substantive issues with the paper.  But don't turn in some half-baked
crap on March 24.<P>

Prepare a report on the topic you've claimed and described in
assignment 3.  Your report should summarize the topic and current
research on the topic succinctly and precisely.  The paper should be
around 5 pages for each member of your team.  That is the average team
of 5 should plan on 25 pages.  It should indicate that you have done
the research necessary to understand the topic.  Don't play tricks
with margins or figures to pad it.  I'd rather see a credible effort
that's a few pages short than see a 25-page paper with 3 inch
margins and 15 figures.  The basic criteria of success is that you
covered the topic well and said interesting things.<P>

It is expected that each member of the group will do a similar amount
of work on the project, but it must be a coherent effort.  Designate
an editor to merge the various sections into a meaningful, flowing
narrative. It's distressing to read a paper that was obviously
written by 5 different people with different styles, vocabularies,
grammars, etc. who didn't even bother to see if they were repeating
what others had already said. <P>

Beginning Monday (3/24), you should be prepared to give an
(approximately 25 minute) presentation on your topic and answer any
questions that may arise relating to it.  Please prepare PowerPoint
(or equivalent) slides to accompany your talk. <i>The presentation
order is the same as the order of groups in the "lottery," and is
posted on the syllabus page, at the top.</i><P>

It is not mandatory that all members of the group speak during your
presentation.  Each of you can present a portion, or the group can
designate one or two group members to present.  That's up to the
group.  If you are ambitious and would prefer to make a video rather
than a presentation, that would be terrific.  But the video should be
of high quality and present the topic well.  Here is an excellent
example from a previous
class: <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAWk-RmN93w&feature=youtu.be">Drone
Video</A>.<P>

<!-- Your poster does not have to be poster-sized.  It can be on an 8 1/2
by 11 sheet.  The idea is the type of poster that would be suitable
(if expanded to full size) to present the topic at a conference poster
session.  There are numerous examples of such posters in ACES.  A
sample poster in PowerPoint format is
here: <A HREF="HuntMoorePoster.ppt">Sample poster.</A> -->

Some guidelines for preparing the report are
here: <A HREF="writing.html"> report writing guideline</A>.  Some
additional general suggestions are
here: <A HREF="hints-on-writing-a-paper.html">suggestions</A>.  The most
important proviso is to make sure that you don't plagarize.  If you
don't understand the basic guidelines of academic honesty, learn them.
If you get lazy and try to copy your report from the Internet, you
will get an F if you're caught, and you may face other academic
penalties.  Be sure to include references for all the sources you use.
If you have too few references, it will indicate a lack of effort.<P>

<HR>

<H2>CS361C Assignment 4b </H2>

<P><B>Due:</B> on an ongoing basis throughout the presentation period.<P>

For each day that presentations are given, you should prepare two
"quiz" questions for each of the presentations (including your own).
Imagine that you were preparing a quiz to test your classmates'
attentiveness during the presentation.  Write two questions to see if
they were paying attention.  Make your questions about the substantive
issues of the presentations, not about trivial matters.  They should
be questions that would be answered by a short essay, not short answer
questions. These will be collected at the end of the class in which
the presentation is given, so you must be attentive to the
presentations.  If a presentation is continued to the subsequent
class, the questions for that presentation should be submitted on the
day it finishes.<P>

<b>Each individual is expected to do this assignment, even if working
with a team on the paper and presentation. Do not copy someone else's
questions.</b><P>

Your submission will be broken up into N sections (where N is the
number of presentations on that day) with a heading and the two
questions for that topic.  If you're attending and attentive to the
presentations, this should be quite easy.<P>

<HR>

<H2>CS361C Assignment 4c </H2>

<P><B>Due:</b> TBA. <P>

The final revised version of your paper and poster will be submitted
on 4/30.  You must address any substantive issues noted by the grading
of the draft.
