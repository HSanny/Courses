<H2>CS378 Assignment 4 </H2>

<P><B>Due:</B> Friday, February 28, 2014.

<H3>The Assignment</H3>

Hopefully, by now you have thought about your project topic. It's time
to get started on the project in earnest. By February 28, you should do
the following:
<ol> 
<li> Reserve your project topic with Dr. Young. <BR><BR>
<!-- <li> Assemble your team of 3 or 4 total students. <b>If you have a
  strong preference for working alone, please rethink that.  There's
  not enough time for all of the presentations if many students work
  alone or in pairs.</b>  Inform Dr. Young of the composition of your
  team. <BR> <BR> -->
<li> Create and submit a document containing the following:<Br><BR>

<ol>
  <li> a short but informative description (a few paragraphs) describing your
    project topic and why it is relevant to this class; and <BR><BR>
  <li> at least 10 resourses you have found (on-line or otherwise)
    that you will use as sources for your project research.  List them
    with descriptions in the form of an annotated bibliography. If the
    resources are on-line resources, be sure that you include
    a URL.  Use good citation style.<BR>
</ol>
</ol>
Understand that the topic you choose has to support a sizable research
paper and an interesting presentation.  In general, the paper will be
<i>around 5 pages for each member of your team</i>.  If your team has
five members, your paper will be around 20 pages.  (If a member of
your team has dropped the class, you can reduce the size accordingly.)
So, don't pick something trivial or so focused that you can't imagine
producing that.<P>


<!-- <H3>Possible Topics</H3>

The following are some possible topics for your CS378 project.  You'll
write a paper on the topic and prepare a "poster" as if you were
presenting at a conference or symposium.  There are many examples of
such posters around ACES.  Here's an
example: <A HREF="HuntMoorePoster.ppt">poster example.</A>.

<P>
The topics below are simply suggestions.  You are free to define your
own topic or to revise one of these.  You are encouraged to find a
topic relating to CyberWarfare, but you don't have to do so.  However,
your topic must deal with a substantive issue in information assurance
and security and must be approved by Dr. Young.  You will be
submitting a report on the topic and preparing a "poster presentation"
on your topic. <P> -->

No two groups may choose the same topic, though topics may be
related.  So if you find one of the following attractive, stake your
claim early.  There is more than enough material for a book on a
variety of topics, but some likely will require more digging
than others. <P>

<!-- If you are feeling somewhat ambitious, Prof. Shmatikov often posts
lists of topics for projects for his security classes.  You might look
there for additional ideas: <A

If you are interested in a topic that has been taken, but lists "open to
teaming" let me know and I'll arrange communication for you.
