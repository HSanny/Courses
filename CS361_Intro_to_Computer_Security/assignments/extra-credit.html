<H2>CS361C Extra Credit Assignment </H2>

<P><B>Due:</B> Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at classtime<P>

Please submit a hard copy of this assignment to Dr. Young.  If you can't
be in class that day, send an electronic copy.<P>

<B>Note you can work with up to two other students on this project.  Be sure
  to identify the members of the team and include a short paragraph
  explaining the contributions of each.</B>  There is no specific page
  limit; take as much space as you need to convey the information. You
  will be graded on the quality of your thought, not on your grammar
  or spelling. Nevertheless, you are expected to take care with those
  aspects.<P>

<B>The Assignment:</B> Toward the end of slideset 1b, we discussed the
following question: Given an organization needing to purchase multiple
COTS software products, how can you assure the "security worthiness"
of the purchased products?  The U.S. Army addresses this question via
its networthiness program, also mentioned in the slides.  However, the
sheer volume of products and the limited pool of analysts suggest
that the problem is difficult, if not hopeless, especially if all
products must be subjected to the most stringent scrutiny.  But maybe
there's a more rational approach to this problem.  Your task is to
look at this problem with fresh eyes and suggest how you'd go about
solving it.<P>

<b>Your Deliverable:</b> Produce a white paper (report) for the Army
suggesting an approach that is likely to be effective in addressing
this problem.  Be as creative as you can, but make sure that you
justify your suggestions.<P>

<i>Note: this assignment relates to a paper I'm considering writing.
If you come up with some really novel ideas, perhaps you'll get
cited in the paper.</i><P>
