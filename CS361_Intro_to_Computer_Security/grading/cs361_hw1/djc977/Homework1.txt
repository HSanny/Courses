Lecture 1
#############################################################
1) What uses of the term “security” are relevant to your everyday life?
	Personal security, system security, network security

2) What do these have in common?
Each of them are a way to keep personal information PERSONAL, which is very important to me
	
3) Have you been a victim of lax security?
	Yes, in fact I recently had to change my eBay password because of their poor security protocols.

4) What is the likelihood that your laptop is infected? How did you decide?
	Very low - I am a very experienced windows user and I take steps through firewall settings, agressive antivirus and filescanning, and javascript screening to ensure that my system is not compromised.

5) What security measures do you take on your laptop?
	I take steps through firewall settings, agressive antivirus and filescanning, and javascript screening to ensure that my system is not compromised.

6) Do you think they are effective?
	Considering I haven’t had a computer virus or any strange data packets leaving my system for the last two years, I’d say I’ve done a pretty good job keeping my system sanitized.

7) Conside the quote from the FBI official on slide 10. Do you think it over-states the case? Justify your answer.
	I do not think it overstates the case of massive vulnerabilities in our nation’s cyber sercurity. Almost all of our public works systems are connected to the internet and aren’t very well protected. It would not be very hard to wreak massive havok

8) What is the importance in learning about computer security?
	Computers are shaping how our world works in a BIG way. It’s incredibly important to know what’s happening inside your magic black box and to be able to control what it is and isn’t doing.
####################################################################
Lecture 2
####################################################################
1) Consider the five reasons given why security is hard. Can you think of other factors?
	In my oppinion, one of the biggest factors is that many people that interact with secure systems don’t care about security or are ignorant to the threats that an insecure system can pose

2) Is there a systematic way to enumerate the “bad things” that might happen to a program? Why or why not?
	No, not really. There are so many different factors that can affect the environment that a program is running in that it is impractical and hard to enumerate each and every possible interaction a program might have with its environment

3) Explain the asymmetry between the defender and attacker in security.
	Defenders are at the distinct disadvantage of having to cover every possible angle where attackers only need a single weak point 

4) Examine the quotes from Morris and Chang. Do you agree? Why or why not?
	I completely agree with their viewpoints. Having a system is always a risk, and keeping it and its contents secure is always a calculated risk. You can never remove ALL of the risk associated with a networked machine.

5) Explain the statement on slide 8 that a tradeoff is typically required.
	Like Morris and Chang said, you can have a TOTALLY secure system by making it totally unusable. The more usable something is (or the more easily accessible), the easier it is for enemies to also use or access it. 

#####################################################################
Lecture 3
#####################################################################
1) Define “risk”
	It’s the possibility that some outside force or entity can adversely affect whatever you’re trying to accomplish

2) Do you agree that software security is about managing risk?
	Yes, totally! You have to make tradeoffs as you design and build

3) Name and explain a risk you accept, one you avoid, one you mitigate, and one you transfer
Accept: Having my email hosted on servers that I do not own, I have no control over that system’s security
	Avoid: I don’t pirate software or download from any unknown sources
	Mitigate: I use constantly-scanning antivirus to minimize the damage that a virus or unwanted program can do to my system
	Transfer: I have renter’s insurance for my computer in case someone breaks in and steals my physical hardware.

4) Evalute annualized loss expectancy as a risk management tool
	It’s not a bad idea, but you can still get surprised on the odd time that a very low-frequency but high cost event does happen. I would use it as a risk mitigation tool, but I would probably still transfer that big cost, low frequency risk to an insurance company.

5) List some factors relevant to rational risk assesment 
	Frequency of occurance and cost of occurance

#####################################################################
Lecture 4
#####################################################################
1) Explain the key distinction between the lists on slides 2 and 3
	Slide 2 lists the goals, and slide 3 lists the tools we can use to reach those goals

2) Consider your use of computing in your personal life. Which is most important: confidentiality, integrity, or availability? Justify your answer.
	Probably confidentiality, I participate in cryptocurrency and I do most of my banking online - it is VERY important to me to make sure no one but ME has access to that information.

3) What does it mean to “group and categorize data”?
	To assign a level of security to a group of data, basically separating information so you don’t have everything in one big bin.

4) Why might authorizations change over time?
	Because an individual’s standing may change with time and it is important to update authorizations to reflect those changes.

5) Some of the availability questions seem to relate more to reliability than to security. How are the two related?
	If the goal of an attacker is to make a service unusable, it is the job of security to maintain reliability.

6) In what contexts would authentication and non-repudiation be considered important?
	Online transactions, such as Amazon and eBay would not work without authentication and non-repudiation

#####################################################################
Lecture 5
#####################################################################
1) Describe a possible metapolicy for a cell phone network. A military database?
	Cell network: keep people who do not pay for our service off of our network
	Military DB: Prevent unauthorized personel from accessing sensitive data.

2) Why do you need a policy if you have a metapolicy?
	A metapolicy gives the goal and intentions of a security policy, the policy is the actual means that a metapolicy will be fulfilled.

3) Give three possible rules within a policy concerning students	‘ academic records
	1) Instructors can only change grades for courses that they taught
	2) Only the owning student and the registrar can look at a student’s records
	3) A student can never change an academic record

4) Could stakeholders interests conflict in a policy? Give an example.
	Yes, if a security policy conflicts with how a stakeholder wants to interact with information, that would be a definite conflict of interests

5) For the example of student SSN’s, state the likely metapolicy
	Keep anyone but the SSN holder from accessing a student’s SSN

6) Explain the statement: “If you don’t understand the metapolicy, it is hard to justify and evaluate the policy”
	If someone doesn’t understand the goal for rules to achieve, then the rules themselves won’t make much sense either. Understanding the metapolicy is the first step to understanding the policy.

#####################################################################
Lecture 6
#####################################################################
1) Why is military security mainly about confidentiality? Are there also aspects of availability and integrity?
	The biggest negatives in military security happen when information is leaked out, so it’s only natural that confidentiality is its biggest focus. There are aspects of availability and integrity, but they are but a shadow of how important confidentiality is.

2) Describe the major threat in our MLS thought experiment
	Individuals accessing information that they should not be able to.

3) Why do you think proviso is there?
	It limits the scope of our problem and makes it easier to conceptualize

4) Explain the form of labels that we’re using.
	Unclassified/Classified/Secret/Top Secret describe the level of importance of a piece of information. Crypto/Nuclear/Janitorial/Personnel describe particular topics of information that they may want to keep segregated

5) Why do you suppose we’re not concerned with how labels get there?
	Because it has no bearing on how we access the data

6) Rank the facts listed on slide 6 by confidentiality
	Cafeteria
	Softball game
	Jones got a raise
	Smith didn’t get a raise
	British broke enigma
	D-day invasion

7) Invent labels for documents containing those facts
	Cafeteria	(Unclassified: {})
	Softball game	(Unclassified: {})
	Jones got a raise	(Confidential: {Personnel})
	Smith didn’t get a raise	(Confidential: {Personnel})
	British broke enigma	(Secret: {Crypto})
	D-day invasion	(Top Secret: {War plans})

8) Justify the rules for “mixed” documents
	If there is more than one interest involved in a document, it should have all of those labels affixed to it. Make sure that only the right people are able to read any bit of information

#####################################################################
Lecture 7
#####################################################################
1) Document labels are stamped on the outside. How are labels affixed to humans?
	By giving those people security clearance in the form of an ID card or an entry in a database.

2) Explain the difference in semantics of labels for documents and labels for humans
	For documents, the labels indicate the minimum level of clearances needed to view that document. For humans, the labels indicate the maximum level of clearances they are able to view.

3) In the context of computers what do you think are the analogies of documents and humans?
	Documents : files
	Humans : users

4) Explain why the principle of least privelage makes sense
	Giving someone the very lowest clearance possible serves to reduce the overall access into a system, which helps to minimize risk

5) For each of the pairs of labels on slide 6, explain why the answers in the third column do or do not make sense
	1st row - Makes sense because the clearance dominates the sensitivity with the correct topics
	2nd row - Makes sense because clearance does not dominate sensitivity
	3rd row - Makes sense because clearance dominates sensitivity

#####################################################################
Lecture 8
#####################################################################
1) Why do you think we introduced the vocabulary terms: objects, subjects, actions?
To disambiguate and better define the mechanics of MLS 

2) Prove that dominates is a partial order (reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric).

3) Show that dominates is not a total order

4) What would have to be true for two labels to dominate each other?

5) State informally what the Simple Security property says.
	you can only look at an object if your level and clearance are >= that of the object

6) Explain why it’s “only if” and not “if and only if”

#####################################################################
Lecture 9
#####################################################################
1) Why isn’t Simple Security enough to ensure confidentiality?
	Because someone with top secret clearance could take that info and write it to an unclassified document - simple security hasn’t been violated but confidentiality has been.

2) Why do we need constraints on write access?
	Because while in the military world they trust their subjects to not write where they shouldn’t, that doesn’t mean that everyone trusts their subjects in the same way. Constraining write access helps to cut down on covert channels. 

3) What is it about computer, as opposed to human beings, that makes that particularly important?
	Programs working on the authority level of a subject could be doing malicious things without the knowledge or consent of the subject. Humans know what they’re doing (usually), but it’s very easy for a computer to do something without its user knowing.

4) State informally what the *-Property says
	You can only “write up” or to the exact same level as yourself.

5) What must be true for a subject to have both read and write access to an object?
	The subject must have the exact same clearance as the object he wants to read and write to.

6) How could we deal with the problem that the General (top secret) can’t send orders to the private (Unclassified)?
	We could increase the clearance of the private and maintain simple security

7) Isn’t it a problem that a corporal can overwrite the war plan? Suggest how we might deal with that.
	Have more precise control over write access, something as simple as the *-Property is bound to have some holes.

#####################################################################
Lecture 10
#####################################################################
1) Evaluate changing a subject’s level (up or down) in light of weak tranquility
	Raising the level of a subject could be bad since you may potentially give a lower clearance subject access to data it shouldn’t be able to see. Lowering the level of a subject should be fine as long as they don’t carry any high-level information with them.

2) Why not just use strong tranquility all the time?
	It limits flexibility and makes it impossible to change the level of an object, which can reduce overall productivity

3) Explain why lowering the level of an object may be dangerous
	You may potentially expose high level information that shouldn’t be visible without high clearance.

4) Explain what conditions must hold for a downgrade (lowering object level) to be secure.
	The object must not contain any high level information, and those who will gain access to that information should require access to the new info.

#####################################################################
Lecture 11
#####################################################################
1) Suppose you wanted to build a (library) system in which all subjects had read access to all files, but write access to none of them. What levels could you give to subjects and objects?
	All subjects have high level and all objects have low level

2) Why wouldn’t you usually build an access control matrix for a BLP system?
	Because the matrix would be millions by millions large because of the massive number of clearances and levels. Also, you don’t need a table to look up values because you can compute access with simple security and the *-property

#####################################################################
Lecture 12
#####################################################################
1) Suppose you had hierarchical levels L, H with L < H, but only had one category A. Draw the lattice

					(H,(A))
				    ^     ^
				   /       \
				(H,())   (L,(A))
				   ^       ^
				    \     /
					 (L,())
	
2) Given any two labels in a BLP system, what is the algorithm for finding their LUB and GLB?
	

3) Explain why upward flow in the lattice really is the metapolicy for BLP.
	Because BLP’s metapolicy is that “information flows up”, and the lattice of labels illustrates that very cleanly

#####################################################################
Lecture 13
#####################################################################
1) Explain how BLP rules are supposed to enforce the metapolicy in the example on slide 1.
	Because BLP rules dictate that information flows from low to high, not high to low. Therefore, based on that lattice, BLP is able to satisfy that metapolicy

2) Argue that the READ and WRITE operations satisfy BLP.
	Because READ can only be done on a topic that you dominate, information will be flowing up (from low into your high) and because WRITE can only be done on a topic that dominates you, information will be flowing up (from your low to high).

3) Argue that the CREATE and DESTROY operations given satisfy BLP.
	Because CREATE and DESTROY do not give a message to indicate success or failure, there can be no flow of information along CREATE and DESTROY, so BLP is still satisfied

4) What has to be true for the covert channel on slide 5 to work?
	Case 0 and case 1 must happen in the same order each time, every time. Otherwise, that “bit” of information is lost to uncertainty

5) Why is the DESTROY statement there?
	So that the process can happen in the same way each time every time

6) Are the contents of any files different in the two paths?
	No, the difference is that SL is not able to access the file and write a change to it. If it is unable to make a change to the file, it knows a distinct bit of information is being indicated

7) Why does SL do the same thing in both cases? Must it?
	Yes, it has to because it is effectively the control or the carrier wave (to draw a parallel to transmission) on which SH can modulate a bit of data

8) Why does SH do different things? Must it?
	SH does different things so that a single bit of information can be transmitted per time epoch. Without SH doing something different, there would be no information transmission

9) Justify the statement on slide 7 that beings: “If SL ever sees…”
	Since SL does the same thing every time, if SH does something different, then a bit of information MUST have been transmitted over the covert channel, violating the metapolicy.

#####################################################################
Lecture 14
#####################################################################
1) Explain why “two human users talking over coffee is not a covert channel”
	Because the flow of information is happening outside of the system. A covert channel occurs by manipulating some attribute in a secure system to transmit information.

2) Is the following a covert channel? Why or why not?

			Send 0	|	Send  1
----------------------------------------------------
Write (SH, F0, 0)	| Write (SH, F0, 1)
Read (SL, F0)		| Read (SL, F0)

	No, because there is no difference in what SL will be able to see between send 0 and send 1

3) Where does the bit of information transmitted “reside” in Covert Channel #1?
Within the state of the system, more specifically, the inability to access a file based on non-existance or missing permissions

4) In Covert Channel #2?
	In the timing of how long it takes a process to run. So if a process gives up its processing time early, another process will be able to detect that as a difference from the norm, so a covert channel exists there.

5) In Covert Channel #3?
	In the order that two sectors of a disk are seeked over. By leaving the read head closer to one sector over another, information can be transferred in the order of one sector being accessed over another.

6) In Covert Channel #4?
	In if “h” is even or odd. The value of “l” is determined in the program flow of a process. Very sneaksy.

7) Why might a termination channel have low bandwidth?
	What if a computation doesn’t terminate or takes much longer than usual? Much lower transmission speeds (lower bandwidth)

8) What would have to be true to implement a power channel?
	That power is consumed in a uniform way each and every time a system or process is used.

9) For what sort of devices might power channels arise?
	Cellular devices (fixed power amount) or any mobile system where power levels are a fixed and scarce resource.

#####################################################################
Lecture 15
#####################################################################
1) Explain why covert channels, while appearing to have such a low bandwidth, can potentially be very serious threats
	Because they can run for indefinite periods of time, in which even a low bandwidth channel can transmit a very damaging amount of data. Additionally, computers process billions of operations per second, so a low bandwidth operation done billions of time each second ends up have a very high bandwidth.

2) Why would it be infeasible to eliminate every potential covert channel?
	It is practically infeasible to eliminate every POTENTIAL covert channel, so dealing with covert channels becomes an exercise in risk management. There are just too many possible vectors of attack.

3) If detected, how could one respond appropriately to a covert channel?
	By monitoring the covert channel for patterns of usage that could indicate an attacker exploiting it, by eliminating it through modification of the system implementation, or by reducing the bandwidth of the channel by introducing noise.

4) Describe a scenario in which a covert storage channel exists
	Both sender and receiver have access to the attributes of some shared object. 

5) Describe how this covert storage channel can be utilized by the sender and reciever
	The sender must be able to modify the attributes and the receiver must be able to view the attributes. Additionally, some means of synchronization is required to ensure that both sender and receiver are on the same “wavelength”

#####################################################################
Lecture 16
#####################################################################
1) Why wouldn’t the “create” operation have an R in the SRMM for the “file existance” attribute?
	Because “create” does not indicate different behavior for successful or unsuccessful creation. Additionally, the outcome of the operation is the same for success or failure, which does not allow for information transmission.

2) Why does an R and M in the same row of an SRMM table indicate a potential channel?
	Because it is then possible for one entity to use an operation to modify and another entity to read for the difference. This allows for a transmission of information.

3) If an R and M are in the same column of an SRMM table, does this also indicate a potential covert channel? Why or why not?
	No, because the same column is looking at different file attributes according to different system operations. There is no covert channel there because information can only be transmitted across a common system resource (for storage channels)

4) Why would anyone want to go through the trouble to create an SRMM table?
	It is a useful tool for investigating potential covert channels, and is a useful visualization to control and standardize information flows.
