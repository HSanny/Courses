---------------------------LECTURE 1 QUESTIONS--------------------------
1. What uses of the term security are relevant to your everyday life?
	In terms of computers and online activity, security is relevant in many aspects such as my online banking or communication via email or any other method. It is also important that information on my computer is safe.
	
2. What do these have in common?
	Confidnetiality. I do not want others being able to see any transaction I make online, and I do not want others to be able to see what is on my computer.

3. Have you been a victim of lax security?
	Yes, I had been lax on changing passwords for an email address which was used to send spam emails to all my contacts.

4. What is the likelihood that your laptop is infected? How did you decide?
	I would think that there is a low likelihood of my computer being infected based on the fact that I am carful with my online browsing and scans come up clean.

5. What security measures do you employ on your laptop?
	I am careful with my online activities, I update software when they become available, and use a free antivirus to run scans on my system. 

6. Do you think they are probably effective?
	I think discrepency and updating would be the most effective. I dont think running antivirus does much more than give me the peace of mind of believing that I am safe.


7. Consider the quote from the FBI of?cial on slide 10. Do you think it overstates the case? Justify your answer.
	No I do not think that that is an overstatement. Being able to access and infect large numbers of computers gives attackers the capability of DDOS and botnet attacks. Although I computer attack does not have the physical distructive force of, say, a nuclear attack, the physical effects felt after a computer attack can cause large ammounts of dammage. For example, a computer attack on utilities can leave a city without power insueing a spike in crime, or a malfunction in a powerplant that could cause widespread dammage.

8. What is the importance in learning about computer security?
	Learning about security is important to protect ourselves, to think critically about security in future employment, and to be able to counteract the efforts of people with malicious intent. 

----------------------------LECTURE 2 QUESTIONS----------------------------------
1. Consider the five reasons given why security is hard. Can you think of other
factors?
	Another factory could be that as interconnectability ammong computers becomes more prevelant, and the use of computers becomes more widespread, more people with possible malicious intent are gaining access to computers and the internet. These people do not need technical knowledge to be able to cause damage as hacking tools are readily available online. 
	It might also be the case that industry fights back agains security measures if those measures make using their product more complicated.

2. Is there a systematic way to enumerate the bad things that might happen
to a program? Why or why not?
	No, there is not a systematic way to enumerate the bad things that might happen to a program because those things may yet be unknown.

3. Explain the asymmetry between the defender and attacker in security.
	There is an asymmetry in the roles of the defender and attacker in security because a defender need to think of all possible threats an attacker can use against his program, while an attacker only needs to find one vulnerability. 

4. Examine the quotes from Morris and Chang. Do you agree? Why or why
not?
	I do not agree with the statements. There are measures in protecting yourself and your information without forgoing technology completely. These statements are simply exagerated to draw attention.

5. Explain the statement on slide 8 that a tradeoff is typically required
	The statement is simnply pointing out that security measures can hinder good processes and goals in order to make a computer secure. For example, security measures can make a system more comlicated and time consuming if it needs user authentication. Or a security measure can take system resources in performing scans. Both may be necessary to maintain a secure system and will take time and resources but in no way contribute to the goal of a program or system. 

----------------------------------LECTURE 3 QUESTIONS------------------------------
1. Define risk?
	The definition in the class slides states risk as the possibility that a particular threat will adversely impact an information system by exploiting a particular vulnerability.

2. Do you agree that software security is about managing risk?
	No, I think of security as safeguarding yourself from what is possible, regardless of possibility. Although it is better to address greater risk first.

3. Name and explain a risk you accept, one you avoid, one you mitigate, and
one you transfer?
	A risk you might accept is one that is either very unlikely, or one where the cost of addressing the risk costs more that the loss taken without addressing the risk. An example would be to not buy an insurance plan on an inexpensive product at an electronics store.
	A risk one might avoid is downloading from the internet to avoid virus's.
	A risk mitigation example is download content using an old and inexpensive computer as to keep a new computer safe.
	A risk transfer example is to purchase the insurance plan on an electronic item so any that the risk of damage is transfered to the selling company.

4. Evaluate annualized loss expectancy as a risk management tool.
	ALE is not a good risk management tool because it computes the expected value of a scenerio, which is not necesseraly similar to risk.

5. List some factors relevant to rational risk assessment.
	The amount of loss, the possibility of a risk occuring, and the cost of addressing the risk. 

----------------------------------LECTURE 4 QUESTIONS------------------------------
1. Explain the key distinction between the lists on slides 2 and 3
	The items on slide 2 describe goals that a security policy might want to accomplish, while the list on slide 3 are methods or mechanisms for accomplishing those goals.

2. Consider your use of computing in your personal life. Which is most important: conﬁdentiality, integrity, availability? Justify your answer.
	I would say that all three are equally important depending on the circumstances. For example I would want integrity on my online banking, availability while online shopping, and confidentiality of my information in both.

3. What does it mean “to group and categorize data?
	To group and catagorize data means to have similar data stored together with an equal amount of authorization required to access that data which may be different than the authorization needed for different groups and of different importance.

4. Why might authorizations change over time?
	Authorization of an object can change over time if the information stored is no longer sensitive. For example, the plans of a birthday party after the birthday has occured may no longer be sensitive data and the authorization needed to access that data can be lowered. Authorization of a subject can change as the person becomes more or less trusted.

5. Some of the availability questions seem to relate more to reliability than to security. How are the two related?
	Reliability and security are related because an unsecure system in not reliable. It may be succeptable to denial of service attack, or if the system suffered from poor integrity, information becomes unreliable.

6. In what contexts would authentication and non-repudiation be considered important?
	Online shopping and banking.

-----------------------------------Lecture 5 Questions---------------------------

1. Describe a possible metapolicy for a cell phone network? A military database?
	A security policy for a cell phone network may focus less on confidentiality as phone numbers may be available to different people, but will focus more on integrity and non reputiation to make sure your bill is paid and on availability to ensure coverage is available to subscribers. 
	A military database may have a metapolicy that focuses on the control of data flow. The metapolicy would describe what level of personell may access and change what data.

2. Why do you need a policy if you have a metapolicy?
	The metapolicy is the overall goal of the system security, the policy is the implementation of rules to make sure the metapolicy is carried out.

3. Give three possible rules within a policy concerning students academic records.
	Students may see but not change their grades.
	Records are confidential between the student and the school. No one else may view the records.
	Student information within the academic records such as Social Security Numbers must be kept confidential.

4. Could stakeholders interest conflict in a policy? Give an example.
	Yes they can conflict. A company may want to view the grades of a student they seek to hire, but the policy denies access to anyone other than the student to see the grades.

5. For the example given involving student SSNs, state the likely metapolicy.
	Student social secutity numbers  must be kept confidential.
6. Explain the statement: ”If you don’t understand the metapolicy, it becomes difﬁcult to justify and evaluate the policy.
	You can read the policy and see that it blocks or allows certain actions from taking place, but you would not know why it is doing that unless you understood the overall goal of the policy.

------------------------------------------------6 Questions--------------------------

1. Why is military security mainly about confidentiality? Are there also aspects of integrity and availability?
	Because there are a lot of individuals with access to infromation. Of course there are also aspects of integrity and availability. You need to know that data of a certain level is not written over, and that it is available when needed.

2. Describe the major threat in our MLS thought experiment.
	The major threat to our experiment is integrity because information can flow up.

3. Why do you think the proviso is there?
	For this experiment we are only concerned with confidentiality, not integrity or availability.

4. Explain the form of the labels we’re using.
	The labels we are using have a security level paired with a catagory or group of catagories.

5. Why do you suppose we ’re not concerned with how the labels get there?
	We are not assesing subjects trust or the sensitivity of informaiton.

6. Rank the facts listed on slide 6 by sensitivity.
	Ranked from high to low
	1-The Normandy invasion is scheduled for June 6
	2-The Brits have broken the Germin Enigma codes
	3- Col. Jones just got a raise && Col. Smith did not get a raise
	4- The base sofball team has a game tomorrow at 3pm
	5- The cafeteria is serving chopped beef on toast today
	
7. Invent labels for documents containing each of those facts.
	Ranked from high to low
	(H, {Battle Plan})	1-The Normandy invasion is scheduled for June 6
	(H, {Espionage})	2-The Brits have broken the Germin Enigma codes
	(L, {Public Data})	3- Col. Jones just got a raise && Col. Smith did not get a raise
	(L, {Domestic})		4- The base sofball team has a game tomorrow at 3pm
	(L, {Domestic})		5- The cafeteria is serving chopped beef on toast today

8. Justify the rules for mixed documents.
	To control the flow of information from moving down you have to confine the sensitivity level and all catagories of the documents of a mixed containeer to that of the highest sensitivity document. Otherwise a subject unauthorized to read particular information would have access to it if they are allowed to view other documents in the container. 

----------------------------------------------------Lecture 7

1. Document labels are stamped on the outside. How are labels afﬁxed to humans?
	Humans are given clearances or authorization levels.

2. Explain the difference in semantics of labels for documents and labels for humans.
	The label of a document indicates the type of information that it is. The label of a human indicates that persons trustworthiness. 

3. In the context of computers what do you think are the analogues of documents? Of humans?
	The analogues of documents in computers are files and their contents. Humans are users with passwords granting them access to those documents.

4. Explain why the Principle of Least Privilege makes sense.
	If you do not give info to someone, they cannot leak it. So only give people the infromation they need to do their job.

5. For each of the pairs of labels on slide 6, explain why the answers in the third column do or do not make sense.
	The first one is yes because the clearance level of the subject is higher than the sensitivity of the document and the types match.
	The second one is no because the sensitivity of the object is higher than the subject.
	The last one is yes because any classification is higher than no classification, and any type is a superset of no type.

---------------------------------------Lecture 8 Questions----------------------

1. Why do you think we introduced the vocabulary terms: objects, subjects, actions?
	Because these terms can be applicable to more than just computer systems, and cover a wider variety. For example, a subject can be a person or a program.

2. Prove that dominates is a partial order (reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric).
	Reflexive: an authorization level x is equal to itself.
	Transitive: if an authorization leve x is greater than an object level y, and y is greater than an object level z, then x is greater than z, meaning x dominates z.
	Antismmetric: If an object and subject dominate each other, the object and subject have equal sensitivity and authorization levels.
3. Show that dominates is not a total order.
	The dominates relation is partial order because there are situations where neither a subject or object dominate each other. For example, an authorization level of Secret(Crypto) and an object of sensetivity Secret(Nuclear) do not dominate each other.

4. What would have to be true for two labels to dominate each other?
	The the levels and catagories are equal.

5. State informally what the the Simple Security property says.
	A subject can read an object only if it is at its level or below.

6. Explain why it’s “only if  and not if and only if?
	Just because you have the authorization to gain access to an object does not mean that you are guarenteed to gain access. 

-----------------------------------------Lecture 9 Questions--------------------------

1. Why isn’t Simple Security enough to ensure conﬁdentiality?
	Because we need to control write access to ensure information does not move downward. Simple Security only controls read access.

2. Why do we need constraints on write access?
	To ensure that information does not flow downward.

3. What is it about computers, as opposed to human beings, that makes that
particularly important?
	You need to worry about all the procecees and programs that a person is running that might be malicious and write information downwards even if the human is trusted.

4. State informally what the *-Property says.
	A subject can only write information up. The object needs to dominate the subject.

5. What must be true for a subject to have both read and write access to an object?
	The subject and object must dominate each other, meaning they are of equal level and catagory.

6. How could we deal with the problem that the General (top secret) can’t send orders to the private (Unclassiﬁed)?
	The general would need two seperate accounts, one at top secret the other at unclassified. This way he can leave the top secret account and send information through the unclassified account. This way the only informatio sent is that which her personally wrote and not any that a proccess may have copied during his time logged into the top secret account.

7. Isn’t it a problem that a corporal can overwrite the war plan? Suggest how we might deal with that.
	Yes a coporal can overwrite the war plan. We ignore that because we are only dealing with confidentiality. We would need to make integrity rules to deal with this.

------------------------------------------Lecture 10 Questions---------------------------

1. Evaluate changing a subject’s level (up or down) in light of weak tranquility.
	You dont want to change levels arbritrarily. You need to still follow the BLP model. To do so you might want to change the level of objects up, which is equivilant of writing up, but not down because now infrmation is available at lower levels which is the same as writing down. You would not want to lower the level of a subject as it may contain residual information and would thus be writting down, unless the subject is stateless or containing no information.

2. Why not just use strong tranquility all the time?
	It would not be practical. As information sensitivity increases or the trust of a subject increases you would want to also increase their level.

3. Explain why lowering the level of an object may be dangerous.
	Lowering the level of a subject is dangerous because it may have residual information and would be similar to writting down.

4. Explain what conditions must hold for a downgrade (lowering object level) to be secure.
	The object would have to contain only information deemed suitible to downgrade and nothing more. Almost the opposite of the Principle of Least Priviladge, you would only want to downgrade to the highest level of any of the pieces of information in the object.

-----------------------------------------Lecture 11 Questions--------------------------

1. Suppose you wanted to build a (library) system in which all subjects had read access to all ﬁles, but write access to none of them. What levels could you give to subjects and objects?
	To do this you would want to give all subjects high level of authorization and give the objects or files low level of sensitivity. This way the subjects can read the files but cannot overwrite them which would contradict the BLP policy. 

2. Why wouldn’t you usually build an access control matrix for a BLP system?
	You will have a very large matrix with lots of empty slots since most subjects will not have access to most objects.

-----------------------------------------Lecture 12 Questions-------------------------
1. Suppose you had hierarchical levels L, H with L < H, but only had one category A. Draw the lattice. (Use your keyboard and editor to draw it; it doesn’t have to be fancy.)
				H{A}
				/  \
			    L{A}    H{} 
			      \    /
				L{}
	Where all the lines are arrows pointing up.

2. Given any two labels in a BLP system, what is the algorithm for ﬁnding their LUB and GLB?
	If x > y then x is the LUB and y is the GLB
	else if x < y then x is the GLB and y is the LUB

3. Explain why upward ﬂow in the lattice really is the metapolicy for BLP.
	Because information can only be pulled up as high level reads from low level, or it can be pushed up as infromation is written from low to high.
-------------------------------------Lecture 13 Questions----------------------------

1. Explain how the BLP rules are supposed to enforce the metapolicy in the
example on slide 1.
	The rules of the BLP system, that is Simple Security, the *-Property, and the Tranquility Property, all enforce the metapolicy of allowing information to flow from low to high and not from high to low. This is accomplished because by Simple Security high can read from low, by the *Property low can write to high, and by weak tranquility levels can change so that they do not contradict the metapolicy.

2. Argue that the READ and WRITE operations given satisfy BLP.
	READ(S,O) satisfies BLP because S has to dominate O in order to get its value, meaning information is only flowing up.
	WRITE(S,O,V)satisfies BLP because O must dominate S for V to be written to O. This means information agian is only flowing up.

3. Argue that the CREATE and DESTROY operations given satisfy BLP.
	CREATE(S,O) satisfies BLP because an object is only created of it does not already exist anywhere in the system. Otherwise creating a lower level object of the same name as a higher level object might draw information down.
	DESTROY(S,0) satisfies BLP because it is similar to writting up, or overwritting up, which satisfies BLP.

4. What has to be true for the covert channel on slide 5 to work?
	READ has to return 0 if trying to read from low to high.

5. Why is the DESTROY statement there?
	So that the action can be repeated.

6. Are the contents of any ﬁles different in the two paths?
	No, FO will contain a 1 because writting up is allowed.

7. Why does SL do the same thing in both cases? Must it?
	SL must do the same thing in both cases because until it knows what SH is, it cannot possibly do anything different.

8. Why does SH do different things? Must it?
	SH does not need to do anything different, it either created LO or it did not. What happens is related to SL.

9. Justify the statement on slide 7 that begins: “If SL ever sees...”
	From the previous example we can see that SL can see different result dependent on SH. This is an obvious violation of the metapolicy which states that information cannot flow down.

-------------------------------------------------Lecture 14 Questions-------------

1. Explain why “two human users talking over coffee is not a covert channel."
	Because a covert channel exists within the system.
	
2. Is the following a covert channel? Why or why not?

	    Send 0     |     Send 1
	
     ----------------------------------------

    Write (SH, F0, 0)  |   Write (SH, F0, 1)

    Read (SL, F0)      |   Read (SL, F0)

	This is not a covert channel because no matter what SH does, it makes no difference to SL. SL gets nothing different in both cases. That is assuming object F0 was created with high sensitivity so that SL cannot read it.

3. Where does the bit of information transmitted “reside” in Covert Channel #1?
	Within the state of the system.

4. In Covert Channel #2?
	In the timing used on the clock.

5. In Covert Channel #3?
	It resides in where the read head was last left off.

6. In Covert Channel #4?
	It is an implicit channel where the value of h directly influences the value of l.

7. Why might a termination channel have low bandwidth?
	Waiting for a process to terminate of not takes time.

8. What would have to be true to implement a power channel?
	You would have to be able to destinguish between high and low power consumption, and the power cannot be depleted. The lower level subject might also have to be external to the subject it it monitoring.

9. For what sort of devices might power channels arise?
	It can arise in a smartcard.

-----------------------------------Lecture 15 Questions--------------------

1. Explain why covert channels, while appearing to have such a low bandwidth, can potentially be very serious threats.
	They can operate at thousands of bits per second with no impact on the system processing.

2. Why would it be infeasible to eliminate every potential covert channel?
	It is not possible to identify every covert channel. 

3. If detected, how could one respond appropriately to a covert channel?
	Change the system implementation to get rid of the channel.
	Reduce the bandwidth with noise.
	Monitor the channel to detect intrusion.

4. Describe a scenario in which a covert storage channel exist.
	The existance of a file.

5. Describe how this covert storage channel can be utilized by the sender and
receiver.	
	An atribute of the files existance can be modified by a sender and a reciever can check to see if the file exists.
	

-------------------------------------Lecture 16 Questions----------------------

1. Why wouldn’t the “create” operation have an R in the SRMM for the “ﬁle
existence” attribute?
	Because it does not get any info back from the creation. If the create is successful nothing is returned and the new object exists. If the object already exists nothing happens and nothing is returned.

2. Why does an R and M in the same row of an SRMM table indicate a potential channel?
	Because the attribute can be refferenced and modified, allowing a potential storage channel.

3. If an R and M are in the same column of an SRMM table, does this also
indicate a potential covert channel? Why or why not?
	No, because they are on different attributes.

4. Why would anyone want to go through the trouble to create an SRMM
table?
	To find potential covert channels.
