CS361 Questions: Week 1
These questions relate to Module(s) 1. Type your answers and submit them via email to the TA by 5pm on Thursday, June 12.
Lecture 1
	1. What uses of the term “security” are relevant to your everyday life?
Personal security, Corporate security, Personnel security, Energy security, Homeland security, Operational security, Communications security, Network security, System security.
	2. What do these have in common?
Protection of assets against threats.
	3. Have you been a victim of lax security?
Malware trackers on my laptop.
	4. What is the likelihood that your laptop is infected? How did you decide?
Not very likely. I've run system scans with anti-malware programs.
	5. What security measures do you employ on your laptop?
Download only from trusted sources, scan any suspicious downloads, and routinely run system scans.
	6. Do you think they are probably effective?
A lot more effective than doing nothing.
	7. Consider the quote from the FBI ofﬁcial on slide 10. Do you think it over- states the case? Justify your answer.
I think the country will not cease to exist in the event of a large cyper attack, but it will be changed forever. 

    "Cyber threats are asymmetric, surreptitious, and constantly evolving—a single individual or a small group anywhere in the world can inexpensively and secretly attempt to 

penetrate systems containing vital information or mount damaging attacks on critical infrastructures. Attack tools and resources are readily available on the Internet and new 

vulnerabilities are constantly discovered and exploited. Moreover, the pervasive interconnectivity of the IT infrastructure makes cyber attacks an increasingly attractive 

prospect for adversaries that include terrorists as well as malicious hackers and criminals."
    Federal Plan for Cyber Security and Information Assurance Research and Development (2006)
	8. What is the importance in learning about computer security?
To enhance the protection of my data and other's.
************
Lecture 2
	1. Consider the ﬁve reasons given why security is hard. Can you think of other factors?
Backdoors may be built into the system that can be exploited.
	2. Is there a systematic way to enumerate the “bad things” that might happen to a program? Why or why not?
There is not. Your program will be available presumably for a lot longer than you have to to secure it, and there will be a hole somewhere.
	3. Explain the asymmetry between the defender and attacker in security.
The defender has to consider all possible avenues to protect, and the attacker only needs to find one avenue that is not covered.
	4. Examine the quotes from Morris and Chang. Do you agree? Why or why not?
I agree because threats are becoming more complicated and robust, and it's impossible for every program you run to have considered every case.
	5. Explain the statement on slide 8 that a tradeoff is typically required.
Related to the quotes from #4, a perfectly secure system is one that isn't used. But that means 0% functionality. To increase functionality, you will have to expose your system 

to threats.
************
Lecture 3
	1. Deﬁne “risk”?
The possibility that a particular threat will adversely impact an imnformation system by exploiting a particular vulnerability.
	2. Do you agree that software security is about managing risk?
Yes.
	3. Name and explain a risk you accept, one you avoid, one you mitigate, and one you transfer?
I accept the risk of crashing while driving, I avoid the risk of driving on a night I will be drinking, I mitigate the risk of losing my inhibitions by drinking at home rather 

than downtown, and I transfer the risk of drinking downtown by having a designated driver.
	4. Evaluate annualized loss expectancy as a risk management tool.
It's a good tool to get an idea of what you need to cover, but not a complete picture.
	5. List some factors relevant to rational risk assessment.
ALE is not the only factor. You must consider large risks carefully even if they have a low chance of occuring.
************
Lecture 4

	1. Explain the key distinction between the lists on slides 2 and 3.
The first list is the overarching goals of computer security, and the second list has mechanisms to achieve those goals.
	2. Consider your use of computing in your personal life. Which is most im- portant: conﬁdentiality, integrity, availability? Justify your answer.
In my life, confidentiality is the most important to me. I don't have sensitive data to be compromised or a server that needs to be available.
	3. What does it mean “to group and categorize data”?
Deciding what data needs the most protection. i.e. credit card info vs. first name.
	4. Why might authorizations change over time?
Promotions within an organization for example. 
	5. Some of the availability questions seem to relate more to reliability than to security. How are the two related?
If a system is not available, it will lose customers. The assets are the customers.
	6. In what contexts would authentication and non-repudiation be considered important?
Online transactions like Amazon.
************
Lecture 5

	1. Describe a possible metapolicy for a cell phone network? A military database?
Allow users to make calls and texts to persons of their choosing. Maintain information at a need to know basis.
	2. Why do you need a policy if you have a metapolicy?
The policy defines what security measures will be used to enable the metapolicy. It's more concrete and you can use it to check your system.
	3. Give three possible rules within a policy concerning students’ academic records.
Only teachers can make modifications. Students and teachers can read data. Outside users can neither read from nor write to these records.
	4. Could stakeholders’ interest conﬂict in a policy? Give an example.
Yes. The NSA installed backdoors on many internet routers.
	5. For the example given involving student SSNs, state the likely metapolicy.
SSN's should be protected from disclosure.
	6. Explain the statement: ”If you don’t understand the metapolicy, it becomes difﬁcult to justify and evaluate the policy.”
Every action should have a purpose. If you keep enacting policies that have no direction, you might just end up reducing usability without increasing desired security.
************
Lecture 6
	1. Why is military security mainly about conﬁdentiality? Are there also aspects of integrity and availability?
You don't want top secret documents read by those who are not authorized to view them. It is also good to maintain integrity so that your information can't be corrupted by 

outsiders.
	2. Describe the major threat in our MLS thought experiment.
People can only see information that in entrusted to them.
	3. Why do you think the proviso is there?
To uncomplicate the thought experiment.
	4. Explain the form of the labels we’re using.
Level of security, and need-to-know categories.
	5. Why do you suppose we’re not concerned with how the labels get there?
That's an integrity problem, and this thought experiment focuses on confidentiality.
	6. Rank the facts listed on slide 6 by sensitivity.
Unconfidential [baseball, cafeteria], confidential [got a raise, didn't get a raise], secret [invasion, codes broken]
	7. Invent labels for documents containing each of those facts.

	8. Justify the rules for “mixed” documents.
It's ok for someone with secret clearance to read unclassified files, but not vice-versa. It is not ok for someone without nuclear clearance to read anything nuclear, not 

matter what the security level.
************
Lecture 7

	1. Document labels are stamped on the outside. How are “labels” afﬁxed to humans?
ID cards with permissions
	2. Explain the difference in semantics of labels for documents and labels for humans.
Document labels are objects, and human labels are subjects.
	3. In the context of computers what do you think are the analogues of documents? Of humans?
Documents -> files. Humans-> Users/programs
	4. Explain why the Principle of Least Privilege makes sense.
It's a good way to mitigate risk. If an enclave is compromised, he can't leak anymore than he already knows.
	5. For each of the pairs of labels on slide 6, explain why the answers in the third column do or do not make sense.
First pair makes sense because he can read from the same group at a lower clearance level. Second makes sense because secret can not read anything top secret. The third makes 

sense because anyone should be able to read unclassified documents with no need-to-know restrictions.
************
Lecture 8:

	1. Why do you think we introduced the vocabulary terms: objects, subjects, actions?
To make it easy to describe security policies
	2. Prove that dominates is a partial order (reﬂexive, transitive, antisymmetric).
Reflexive [(L1 >= L1) && (S1 is a subset of S1)] = true. Transitive [((L1 >= L2) && (L2 >= L3) -> (L1 >= L3)) && ((S3 is a subset of S2) && (S2 is a subset of S1) -> (S3 is a 

subset of S1))] = true. Antisymmetric [(L1 >= L2 && L2 >= L1 -> L1 = L2) && (S1 is a subset of S2 && S2 is a subset of S1 -> S1 = S2)] = true.
L's are linear, and S's are set relations.
	3. Show that dominates is not a total order.
You can have pairs that don't dominate each other. i.e. [Secret {A,B}] to [Classified {C,D}]
	4. What would have to be true for two labels to dominate each other?
They would have to be the same.
	5. State informally what the the Simple Security property says.
Read down, not up
	6. Explain why it’s “only if” and not “if and only if.”
There may be other constraints in the system.
************
Lecture 9

	1. Why isn’t Simple Security enough to ensure conﬁdentiality?
It does not consider write access.
	2. Why do we need constraints on write access?
Because a top secret person can write top secret info to an unclassified document.
	3. What is it about computers, as opposed to human beings, that makes that particularly important?
Trojan horses can leak information without user's consent 
	4. State informally what the *-Property says.
Write up, not down
	5. What must be true for a subject to have both read and write access to an object?
The subject and object must have the exact same labels.
	6. How could we deal with the problem that the General (top secret) can’t send orders to the private (Unclassiﬁed)?
A system to upgrade/downgrade files.
	7. Isn’t it a problem that a corporal can overwrite the war plan? Suggest how we might deal with that.
Changes have to be verified by someone at the written level.
************
Lecture 10:


	1. Evaluate changing a subject’s level (up or down) in light of weak tranquility.
It must not violate the spirit of the security property.
	2. Why not just use strong tranquility all the time?
You might want someone in Top Secret to give information to someone lower. (Marching orders for example)
	3. Explain why lowering the level of an object may be dangerous.
It could contain sensitive information that is not meant for someone at a lower level.
	4. Explain what conditions must hold for a downgrade (lowering object level) to be secure.
It must not contain any information not usually readable by someone at the lower level, and the person doing the checking must be at least as high as the original object, and 

have sufficient knowledge of who can read what.

************
Lecture 11:


	1. Suppose you wanted to build a (library) system in which all subjects had read access to all ﬁles, but write access to none of them. What levels could you give to 	

subjects and objects?
Give all subjects the highest order label, and all objects the lowest order label.
	2. Why wouldn’t you usually build an access control matrix for a BLP system?
The matrix would be huge for most realistic systems, and access permissions can be computed on the fly.
************
Lecture 12


	1. Suppose you had hierarchical levels L, H with L < H, but only had one category A. Draw the lattice. (Use your keyboard and editor to draw it; it doesn’t have to be 	

fancy.)
		(H{A})
		 ^ ^-----(H{})
	(L{A})---|         ^
	   ^-----(L{})-----|
	2. Given any two labels in a BLP system, what is the algorithm for ﬁnding their LUB and GLB?
LUB would be found by combining the dominating subterms, and GLB would be found by combining the dominated subterms.
	3. Explain why upward ﬂow in the lattice really is the metapolicy for BLP.
It demonstrates that data with higher sensitivity cannot flow down to something with lower level.
************
Lecture 13

	1. Explain how the BLP rules are supposed to enforce the metapolicy in the example on slide 1.
Data can be pulled up from High, or pushed up from Low, and data cannot flow downward.
	2. Argue that the READ and WRITE operations given satisfy BLP.
You can only read if subject dominates object; read down. You can only write if object dominates subject; write up/.
	3. Argue that the CREATE and DESTROY operations given satisfy BLP.
Create is basically a write to an object that does not exist yet at subject's current level. No information is read up or written down. Destroy is just like writing garbage 

into an object, which does not violate BLP. You cannot destroy something you cannot write to.
	4. What has to be true for the covert channel on slide 5 to work?
The system cannot allow dublicate object names, and the Low subject must run the same commands independent of what the High subject did.
	5. Why is the DESTROY statement there?
So the instructions can be iterated in a loop without building new objects/increasing memory footprint.
	6. Are the contents of any ﬁles different in the two paths?
No.
	7. Why does SL do the same thing in both cases? Must it?
It can't know what SH does by BLP design, so it cannot modify it's instructions to react.
	8. Why does SH do different things? Must it?
SH has to do different things to signal to SL a 0 or a 1.
	9. Justify the statement on slide 7 that begins: “If SL ever sees...”
If SL gets any information based on SH's actions, this violates BLP.
************
Lecture 14

	1. Explain why “two human users talking over coffee is not a covert channel.”
The flow is not within the system.
	2. Is the following a covert channel? Why or why not?
	Send 0 | Send 1 ------------------------------------------ Write (SH, F0, 0) | Write (SH, F0, 1) Read (SL, F0) | Read (SL, F0)
No, it is just a violation of BLP. It depends on reading data directly.
	3. Where does the bit of information transmitted “reside” in Covert Channel #1?
In the existance status of the files.
	4. In Covert Channel #2?
In the timing function of the processor.
	5. In Covert Channel #3?
In the efficiency of the read head.
	6. In Covert Channel #4?
In the truth value of the if statement
	7. Why might a termination channel have low bandwidth?
The computation might be complex and take a relatively long time to terminate.
	8. What would have to be true to implement a power channel?
You would have to have a way to measure/manipulate amount of power used to a certain object in the system.
	9. For what sort of devices might power channels arise?
I would guess any hardware system with variable control. Maybe even the LED that lights up when your hard disk is reading/writing.
************
Lecture 15

	1. Explain why covert channels, while appearing to have such a low band- width, can potentially be very serious threats.
Because processors are really fast. 
	2. Why would it be infeasible to eliminate every potential covert channel?
You might need status flags that need to be checked, and realistic systems are too complex to scrutinize every read/write interaction.
	3. If detected, how could one respond appropriately to a covert channel?
Eliminate it, reduce the bandwith, or monitor it.
	4. Describe a scenario in which a covert storage channel exists.
There is an attribute in the system that can be modified by a high level object that can be referenced by a low level object.
	5. Describe how this covert storage channel can be utilized by the sender and receiver.
The sender can modulate the attribute while the reciever monitors it.
************
Lecture 16

	1. Why wouldn’t the “create” operation have an R in the SRMM for the “ﬁle existence” attribute?
Because the caller doesn't know if the create was successful or not according to system statuses.
	2. Why does an R and M in the same row of an SRMM table indicate a poten- tial channel?
Because the sender object can modulate an M and the receiver can monitor at R.
	3. If an R and M are in the same column of an SRMM table, does this also indicate a potential covert channel? Why or why not?
No, because all the things in a collumn happen on every call to that function, and when the reciever tries to monitor that function, it will modify its own values/statuses.
	4. Why would anyone want to go through the trouble to create an SRMM table?
To know which functions are least secure, and to decide where to spend resources on fixing.
