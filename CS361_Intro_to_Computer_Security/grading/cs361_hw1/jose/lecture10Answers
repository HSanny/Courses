Evaluate changing a subjectâ€™s level (up or down) in light of weak tranquility.
	It is necessary to allow certain ways of communication. However it can be dangerous. For example a general downgraded to private may have residual information and violate confidentiality


Why not just use strong tranquility all the time?
	Because then how would a general send a message to a private? Furthermore, how will a privates clearance level be upgraded once he gets promoted to general?

Explain why lowering the level of an object may be dangerous.
	Because for example: A general writes a top secret object, then lowers its sensitivity to allow a particular private to read it. This was done in good spirit, but now every single private will be able to read the message which can be dangerous.

Explain what conditions must hold for a downgrade (lowering object level) to be secure.
	To be totally secure, no subject should have residual information about the object.
