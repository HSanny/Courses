Explain why “two human users talking over coffee is not a covert channel.”
	Because a coffe shop is not part of the system. A covert channel must be within the system

Is the following a covert channel? Why or why not?
	No because Sh and Sl are isolated from each other. If Sh is allowed to write f0, that means that f0 is either h or higher. Either way, Sl would not be allowed to collect any sort of information from it by just reading.
	
Where does the bit of information transmitted “reside” in Covert Channel #1?
	In the name of the file

In Covert Channel #2? 
	In the system clock

In Covert Channel #3?
	In the order in which the disk system returns requests

In Covert Channel #4?
	In the value of H (varies depending on if h is odd or even)

Why might a termination channel have low bandwidth?
	Because one has to wait for the computation to either finish or not. Therefore information flows extremely slowly depending on the timeout of the computing machine. For example, if the machine has a timeout of 1 hour and, either the 0 or the 1 bit would take 1 hour.

What would have to be true to implement a power channel?
	That the subject can manipulate the amount of energy a device uses. Also, that the other person can view fluctuations in power levels

For what sort of devices might power channels arise?
	Smart cards are a good example because the energy is supplied by the host computer.
