Explain why covert channels, while appearing to have such a low bandwidth, can potentially be very serious threats
	Because a powerful message can be delivered with just 1 bit. A yes or no answer can be extremely powerful. For example a 1 could inform a spy that the security cameras or off-line and therefore he can infiltrate the base. Furthermore, modern processors are extremely fast so they could still send high amounts of information despite a low bandwidth

Why would it be infeasible to eliminate every potential covert channel?
	Because real system contain thousands of potential covert channel. Moreover, most of this channels will be too noisy to allow communications.

If detected, how could one respond appropriately to a covert channel?
	Eliminate it, restricting the bandwidth by introducing noise into the channel or just monitoring it.

Describe a scenario in which a covert storage channel exists.
	The create action on a BLP system returns a 1 on success and 0 on failure

Describe how this covert storage channel can be utilized by the sender and
receiver
	If a general wants to send "0" to a private, he would create a file named X. Then the private tries to create a file named X and gets a "0" error message. If the general wants to send "1", he would not create a file named X. This way when the private creates X, he would get a success message "1"
