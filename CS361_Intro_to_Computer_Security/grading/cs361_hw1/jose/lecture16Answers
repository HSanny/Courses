Why wouldn’t the “create” operation have an R in the SRMM for the “ﬁle existence” attribute?
	Because the operation create doesn't tell me that fact. I have to infer it. Worded differently, the operation gives me knowledge of an aspect of the attribute but it doesn't tell me anything about it.

Why does an R and M in the same row of an SRMM table indicate a potential channel?
		Because it means that there is a way to modify some info and also read the modification.
	
If an R and M are in the same column of an SRMM table, does this also indicate a potential covert channel? Why or why not?
	No. The only way for a covert channel to work is by playing around with one attribute. A column is linked to a particular action and not an attribute. Therefore, R and M's in the same column provide no mechanism for passing information.

Why would anyone want to go through the trouble to create an SRMM table?
	Because it allows to you detect potential covert channels.
