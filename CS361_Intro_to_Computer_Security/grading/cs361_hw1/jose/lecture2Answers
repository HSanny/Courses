Consider the ﬁve reasons given why security is hard. Can you think of other factors?
	Although it might be included in answer 2 (Bad things never happen), we also have to consider the following: Sometimes every day programs can be disguised as every day use (for example a word processor) but underneath the hood, they might be a key logger. In other words, we also have to consider that people cannot be trusted

Is there a systematic way to enumerate the “bad things” that might happen
to a program? Why or why not?
	No. Some programs may be able to identify all its vulnerabilities, but identifying all possible ways a malicious user can manipulate the system is impossible. 

Explain the asymmetry between the defender and attacker in security
	The person defending must protect every single potential threat. An attacker only needs to focus on 1.
	
Examine the quotes from Morris and Chang. Do you agree? Why or why
not?
	I agree. However, there is a risk associated with everything in life. For example, I could get hit by a meteorite on my way to campus. I think the important thing is to be protected against probable attacks.

Explain the statement on slide 8 that a trade off is typically required.
	The more secure you make a system, the more functionality that is lost.
