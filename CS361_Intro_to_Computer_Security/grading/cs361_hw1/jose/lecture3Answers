Evaluate annualized loss expectancy as a risk management tool.
 It can sometimes be useful but other times it might encourage one to allocate all security resources on a lenient threat. For example, there is a 1% chance of loosing 100,000,000 dollars and a 70% chance of loosing 20,000 dollars one time. You can only protect one option. Annualized risk would suggest protecting the second option, however loosing 20k is tolerable, but loosing 1000k will put you out of business for good
