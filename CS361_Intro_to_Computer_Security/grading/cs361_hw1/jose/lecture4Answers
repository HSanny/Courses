Explain the key distinction between the lists on slides 2 and 3.
	The distinction is between aspects vs mechanisms

Consider your use of computing in your personal life. Which is most important: confidentiality, integrity, availability? Justify your answer.
	Availability. I want to be able to use my computer. What good would the most confident integral machine be if its not available?

What does it mean “to group and categorize data”?
	To assign that data object a level of importance and secrecy. For example, is my social security number important? Should I let other people know it?

Why might authorizations change over time?
	Permissions, clearance levels change all the time. For example a private has a low authorization level but when he gets promoted to General, his authorization level will change.

Some of the availability questions seem to relate more to reliability than to security. How are the two related?
	If a system is very unreliable then it is also unavailable. For example if a system is infected by malware (unreliable) then it will be so slow that is unavailable

In what contexts would authentication and non-repudiation be considered important?
	Authentication: A bank needs to make sure the person accessing a bank account is the right one.
	Non-repudiation: If you buy something on line from Ebay, then you wouldn't want Ebay to say they never received your payment.
