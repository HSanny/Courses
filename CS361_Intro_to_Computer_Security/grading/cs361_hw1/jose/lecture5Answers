Lecture 5:

Describe a possible metapolicy for a cell phone network? A military database?
	For a cell phone network the metapolicy could be to ensure security, confidentiality and integrity of the data being sent across the network.
	For a military database, the metapolicy could be ensuring the confidentiality of the data stored in the database.


Why do you need a policy if you have a metapolicy?
	The policy is just a set rules in order to achieve the metapolicy. If you only have the metapolicy, you know what you have to protect, but not HOW to protect it. Furthermore, a metapolicy is very general so it needs a policy to narrow it down.

Give three possible rules within a policy concerning students’ academic
records.
	Besides the student and certain family members, only administrative staff and system administrators are allowed to access the records.
	Within the students family, only his parents are allowed to access the records.
	The password required to access the records must be reset at the start of every month

Could stakeholders’ interest conﬂict in a policy? Give an example.
	Yes. For example in a social media application, the stake holder's interest might be to learn certain private information about a user. However, the policy might be that private info is encrypted and can only be accessed by the user.

For the example given involving student SSNs, state the likely metapolicy.
	Protect the confidentiality of the students SSN to prevent identity theft

Explain the statement: ”If you don’t understand the metapolicy, it becomes
difficult to justify and evaluate the policy.”
	It is impossible to see if you goal is being achieved if you don't know what it is. In order to evaluate how efficient a set of rules might be, it is crucial to understand what it is that you are trying to achieve.
