Document labels are stamped on the outside. How are “labels” afﬁxed to humans?
	It could be done in a number of ways. For example every human could get a card that lists its clearance label. Very similar to a key

Explain the difference in semantics of labels for documents and labels for humans
	Document labels are referred to as its sensitivity level. Human labels are referred to as clearance levels. A human is allowed to read a document if he has a higher clearance level than the documents sensitivity and his need to know set is a super set of the documents one.

In the context of computers what do you think are the analogues of documents? Of humans?
	Read and Write permissions. For example in Linux, I can create a document and only give users of group X permission to read it

Explain why the Principle of Least Privilege makes sense.
	Because every human is a vulnerability. With this in mind, giving a human access to information he doesn't need is just an unnecessary risk.

For each of the pairs of labels on slide 6, explain why the answers in the third column do or do not make sense.
	Column 1 makes sense because the human has a higher clearance level than the documents sensitivity and his need to know information is a superset of the documents one.
	Column 2 makes sense because the human has a lower clearance level than the documents sensitivity. Therefore he should be able to access it
	Column 3 make sense because the human has a higher clearance level than the documents sensitivity and his need to know information is a superset of the documents one.
