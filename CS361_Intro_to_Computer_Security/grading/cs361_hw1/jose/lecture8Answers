Why do you think we introduced the vocabulary terms: objects, subjects,
actions?
	So the initial military example can be expanded to other contexts such as digital systems. For example in a Linux environment:
	 Document = object = file
	 Subject = military personnel = user
	 action = access the document = read, write, delete, etc

Prove that dominates is a partial order (reﬂexive, transitive, antisymmetric)
	An object can have sensitivity level Top secret and need to know Crypto. A subject can have sensitivity level secret and need to know Crypto and Nuclear. In this example neither one dominates the other. It is therefore a partial order

Show that dominates is not a total order.
	In total order, every element must be comparable. For example in this two labels: TopSecret{nuclear,Crypto}, TopSecret{Watermelons,Apples}. This two labels are not comparable and therefore dominates is not a total order
	
What would have to be true for two labels to dominate each other?
	They both have the exact same clereance/sensivity level and the exact same need to know categories. 

State informally what the the Simple Security property says.
	A subject can read an object if he has a higher clearance its sensitivity and the subjects need to know categories include all the need to know categories of the object.

Explain why it’s “only if” and not “if and only if.”
	Because it is not the only requirement. For example, a subject might have clearance to read a certain file, but it might turn out he is a spy therefore he cannot read it.
