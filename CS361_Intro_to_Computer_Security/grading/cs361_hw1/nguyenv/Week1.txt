** Lecture 1 **
***************

1) Relevant uses of the term "security" in our everyday lives would be home security
systems, computer security programs for virus protection and firewalls, security guards at
the mall, the United States Department of Homeland Security, security cameras in grocery 
stores or gas stations, etc.
2) In general, all the above are trying to "protect assets against threats."
3) Yes, I've had malware, particularly adware, on my computers in the past. I've also left 
my bad out unprotected during gym instead of storing it in a locker or another safe area 
and had cash stolen from me.
4) I think there is a low likelihood that my laptop is infected. I run OSX which doesn't
mean there's no chance my computer would ever be infected but it lowers the possibility.
5) I don't run any antivirus software like I assume most people who run OSX. I mostly just
don't download any weird files to my computer or click on questionable websites.
6) I think it's probably effective or at least has a much lower liklihood of being
infected. I used Ubuntu for PC for a few years without any antivirus and had no issues.
7) I guess this is not too much of an overstatement because all our information is stored
onto computers and so we've become fairly dependent on them. A group of determined people
could potentially employ enough damage to destroy important information beyond repair.
8) More and more is being done and store onto computers. As a consequence, a larger
number of people understand how to use computers thus leading a larger population of
attackers developing more sophisticated techniques. It is important to learn computer
security to protect the increasing amount of sensitive material against an increasing
number of sophisticated attackers.

***************
** Lecture 2 **
***************

1) Keeping secure takes effort that most people do not want to put in. For example, your 
password should be a certain amount of characters containing a mix of lower and uppercase 
letters, numbers, and symbols, and should not be an English dictionary word. All your 
passwords should be different for every websites and should be changed every few months. 
This is huge hastle that most people avoid doing.
Even quick updates on antivirus software can get majorly delayed because people don't 
want to go through the trouble of waiting for their computer to reboot after installation.
2) No because there are potentially an infinite number of ways a hacker could attack a program, 
and the "bad things" that could happen to a program are different for every program.
3) The relationship between the defender and attacker is asymmetrical because the defender
has to protect against any possible attack ahead of the attacker whereas the attacker only
has to seek out one weak spot in the program.
4) Yes, the quotes from Morris and Chang are true. I can't remember the quote exactly, but
it's like saying if you don't want people judging you for what do you do, then don't do
anything at all. In other words, you're going to risk having something or someone do
something bad to you. It is in inevitable that there will be trade-offs to everything.
5) In other words, in order to have a totally secure system, you would need a program in 
which no one could have access to it, which completely defeats the purpose. A functonal 
program will therefore always have exposure to potential threats.

***************
** Lecture 3 **
***************

1) "Risk is the possibility that a particular threat will adversely impact an information 
system by exploiting a particular vulnerability" (Lecture 3, Slide 1). It is how likely a
particular attack will occur.
2) Yes because since you cannot have a perfectly secure system, you must be managing risk
instead.
3) An example of risk acceptance is jaywalking. In return for taking a shortcut, you risk
being hit by an incoming car. An example of risk avoidance is by not using your debit card 
for online purchases. Completely avoiding direct bank account transactions online helps
protect your money and banking information. An example of risk mitigation is by using a
helmet. If an accident were to happen, you would sustain less head injury versus if you
were not wearing one. An example of risk transfer are home security systems. Having a sign
out in your front yard means you are transferring the risk of being broken into by
deferring the risk to your neighbors who do not have a sign out in front.
4) Although it is useful, it should not be the only tool you use in assessing risk
management. For example, if you have a loss type with a very large loss amount but very
scarce risk, that may compute to a fairly low ALE. However, that may not be a very accurate
representation of events. A single very large loss could result in the complete damage of
a system. Thus, in reality, you would still want to place a significant amount of security
into this case although the ALE may show otherwise.
5) Rational risk assessment consists of approaching a system based on a variety of security
factors in systemic manner.

** Lecture 4 **
***************

1) The list on slide 2 lists the types of security breaches whereas the list on slide 3 
lists the types of mechanisms for protecting the security breaches listed previously.
2) I don't think that one is any more important than the the other in my daily life. I'd 
like my sensitive information to stay private, I don't want anyone to mess with my
personal records and change information that would affect my ability to attend school, 
get a job, buy things, etc., and I'd like to be able to access bank statements, homework, 
emails, and whatever else I need at all times. Maybe availibility would be least
important of the three because I have the option to do most things off the computer if I
so choose and it would possibly effect the business more so than me. On the other hand,
being able to access and change sensitive information could be disasterous. 
3) Not all data is equally sensitive and within different levels of security, there are
a number of categorial types that information can be seperated into. It is important to
group and categorize data so that someone with unrestricted access will less likely view
something that they should not. Furthermore, it is more efficient than determining each
item individually.
4) Authorizations may change over time if someone gets promoted and is allowed to view
higher sensitive information. Alernatively, the data itself can become more or less
sensitive and needs to be relabeled throughout its lifetime.
5) Although availibility seems to relate more to reliability than to security, this is 
still an adverse impact to a business or website done by exploiting a vulnerability via
a DoS attack.
6) Authentication and non-repudiation are both imporant when shopping online. You want to
be sure that either party (buyer and seller) are who they say they are and not a scammer.
As for the latter, you also don't want a seller to deny that they ever recieved a buyer's
payment. Likewise, you don't want a buyer to deny that a product was never delivered.

***************
** Lecture 5 **
***************

1) A possible metapolicy for a cell phone policy would be the company cannot sell a user
or consumer's cell phone number to telemarketers or any other buyers. A possible
metapolicy for a military batabase would be that access to the information in that
databases be restricted to the appropriate military and government personel.
2) You still need a policy even if you already have a metapolicy because the metapolicy
can be too general and thus be subject to multiple interpretations. The policy gives
specifications and enforceable guidelines to the system.
3) Three possible rules within a policy concerning students' academic records include:
	1. Faculty and staff may not use student SSNs in documents, files, and postings.
	2. Documents containing SSNs must be desroyed unless deemed necessary.
	3. Documents containing SSNs that are deemed necessary must be kept in secture storage.
4) Yes, a stakeholders' interest could conflict in a policy. For example, a student may
want to change a lower grade to a higher one but that would be against the University's
policy.
5) The likely metapolicy for the exmaple concerning SSNs would be that a student's personal
records should not be used or accessed except in cases where it is deemed necessary.
6) The metapolicy in a way is like stating the type of security breaches (confidentiality,
integrity, accessibility, etc.) and the policy is like stating the method for protecting
such security breaches. Thus, a descriptions of protective mechanisms would make no sense
without the context of what it is protecting against.

***************
** Lecture 6 **
***************

1) Military security is mainly about confidentiality because there are multiple people
working with different rankings or various degrees of trustworthiness who need to access
information at various levels of sensitivity. The information needs to be protected so
that people with lower standings or enemies cannot access confidential data. There are
also aspects of integrity and availibility but to a lesser degree.
2) The major treat is this military thought experiment is that people who are not
authorized to view a piece of information somehow gain access to it.
3) The proviso for this through experiment is in there because including integrity and/or
availibity would introduce further levels of complexity into our situation. We only want
to focus on how to approach security from a confidentiality aspect.
4) The information is labeled according to their level of sensitivity in the form of a
hierarchy where the least sensitive information is classified lower than more sensitive
information. Within each level of sensitivity, there are "need-to-know" categories
seperating the information into different areas of interest.
5) We are not concerned with how the labels get there because this adds another detail of
complexity that does not contribute to what we are trying to accompolish in this thought
experiment.
6) 	Top Secret:
			- The Normandy invasion is scheduled for June 6.
		Secret:
			- The British have broken the German Enigma codes.
		Confidential:
			- Col. Jones just got a raise.
			- Col. Smith didn’t get a raise.
		Unclassified:
			- The base softball team has a game tomorrow at 3pm.
			- The cafeteria is serving chopped beef on toast today.
7) (Top Secret: {Strategy}), (Secret: {Crypto, Allies}), (Confidential: {Payroll}),
and (Unclassified: {}).
8) If a document contains both sensitive and non-sensitive information, you should use the
highest appropriate level because you don't want someone who does not have access to the
higher level to be able to read the information. For information would contains multiple
categories, you need to label the document with all the categories because personel who do
not have access to one of the categories should not be able to access the document. Only
people with access to all the listed categories may read it.

***************
** Lecture 7 **
***************

1) "Labels" are affixed to humans by their job rank or job description. 
2) There are slight differences in the semantics for documents labels and human labels
because they have different relationships to the data inquestion. Documents are the pieces
of information themselves whereas humans access the information.
3) In computers, the analogues of documents are files and the analogues of humans are
the user.
4) The Principle of Least Privilege makes sense because information that cannot be
accessed cannot be leaked. Thus, people should have access to the minimum amount of
information needed to do their job to reduce the liklihood of sensitive informationship
being accessed in a malcious manner.
5) The first row of the table makes sense because the person has clearance to view
Cytpo material at the Secret level so they should be able to view a document that is
within the same Cypto category at the lower Confidential level. The second row of the
table makes sense because the person is cleared to view only material the Secret level but
the information they are trying to access is at a higher level than they are. Thus, they
should not be able to view the material. The last row makes sense because everyone should
have clearance to view material at the Unclassified level.

***************
** Lecture 8 **
***************

1) The terms objects, subjects, and actions are introduced in place of what we have
previously been using because the terms are more general. Objects can be elements
including documents but also folders, databases, etc. Likewise, subjects can be humans as
well as processes, computers, etc.
2) Dominates is partial order because it obeys the
	- Reflexive property: a label is equal to itself. For example, {Unclassified, ()}
	is equal to {Unclassified, ()}.
	- Antisymmetric property: given two labels with security levels A and B,
	if A <= B and B <= A then A = B. For example, {Unclassified, ()} <= {Unclassified, ()}
	and {Unclassified, ()} >= {Unclassified, ()}. Therefore {Unclassified, ()} =
	{Unclassified, ()}.
	- Transitive property: given three labels with security levels A, B, and C, if label
	B is greater or equal to A and label C is greater or equal to B, then label C must be
	greater or equal to A. For example, {Unclassified, ()} <= {Confidential, (Crypto)} and
	{Confidential, (Crypto)} <= {Top Secret, (Crypto)}. Therefore, {Unclassified, ()} <=
	{Top Secret, (Crypto)}.
3) Dominates is not total order because although it is antisymmetric and transitive as
explained above, it is not total - where any two pairs are comparable. In other words, 
you can have two labels that do not dominate one another. For example, there is no ordered 
relationship between {Secret, (Cyrpto)} and {Secret, (Nuclear)}.
4) For (L1, S1) to dominate (L2, S2), (1) L1 must be higher or equal to L2 and (2) S2
must be a subset of S1.
5) The Simple Security Property states that a subject has clearence to read an object only
if the subject domainates the object.
6) The reason the Simple Security Property uses "if" and not "iff" is because the property
is a necessary condition, not a sufficient condition. In other words, the subject may still
be denied access to the object even if the subject dominates the object because there is
some external reason that there would be a confidentiality breach.

***************
** Lecture 9 **
***************

1) The Simple Security Property is not enough to ensure confidentiality because it only
outlines the guidelines for read access. The guidelines for write access are also just as
important for maintaining confidentiality.
2) We need constraints on write access because a subject with read access to a higher
level object is able to write that information as a lower level object. This would not
violate the Simple Security Property but would be a breach of confidentiality.
3) Subjects in the context of computers are often programs operating on behalf of a user
with some level of clearance. A program may have embedded malicious logic that causes it
to leak information without the user's knowledge or consent.
4) The *-Property states that a subject has clearance to write an object only if the
object domaintes the subject.
5) In order for a subject to have both read and write access to an object, the subject and
object must be at the same level.
6) Although the General cannot send orders to the private because it would be in violation
of the *-Property (Top Secret writing to Unclassified), this can be worked around by 
having the General sign out of his Top Secret account and into an Unclassified account.
In effect, you now have Unclassified writing to Unclassified.
7) Yes, a cororeal can overwrite the war plan. In order to preserve integrity, we could
limit write clearance to subjects only if it is at the same level as the object. This way
lower level subject cannot write to higher level objects.

****************
** Lecture 10 **
****************

1) Changing a subject's level down in light of weak tranquility would effect the security
in terms of confidentiality because the subject could be carrying residual information
from the higher levels down to the lower levels. Changing a subject's level up would not
effect the security in terms of confidentiality as information would in a sense be flowing
up in this case.
2) It would be improbable to use strong tranquility all the time because the nature of the
object and/or subject fluxuates throughout time and depends on the current context of the
situation.
3) Lowering the level of an object may be dangerous because the object may still contain
residual information that is highly sensitive.
4) In order for an object to be downgraded, the object must be carefully assessed to make
sure that there is no sensitive information present. It must not violate the conditions of
the security policy. In other words, the object cannot be arbitrarily downgraded without
a thorough check.

****************
** Lecture 11 **
****************

1) A system in which all subjects could have read access to all files but write access to
no files would involve placing all subjects at a HIGH level tier and placing all objects at
a LOW level tier.
2) You would not usually build an access control matrix for a BLP system because subject
and object dominance can be computed "on-the-fly" very easily and most of the time neither
subject or object dominates (i.e. subject have no access to object), so a large area of the
matrix would be empty.

2) Given any two labels in a BLP system, the algorithm for finding their LUB is by tracing
the arrows downwards until there are no points that could possibly be lower. The algorithm
for finding their GLB is by tracing the arrows upwards until there are no points that are
could possibly be higher.
3) Upward flow in the lattice is the metapoliy for BLP because information flowing upwards
preserves the security of the system. If information traveled down, data from higher level
tiers would leak down into lower levels.

****************
** Lecture 13 **
****************

1) The BLP rules are supposed to enforce the metapolicy by restricting the flow of 
information so that information may only flow upwards from lower to higher tiers. Violaton
of the rules would mean information would leak from a more confidential tier down to one
that is more restricted.
2) The READ operation satisfies BLP because subjects from a lower level cannot access
objects from a higher level. There is no flow of information in this case. The WRITE
opertion satisfies BLP because subjects can only write to high level objects. This means
information can only flow upwards.
3) The CREATE operation satisfies BLP because the object is being created at the same
level as the subject. Thus, there is no downward flow of information. The DESTROY operation
satisfies BLP becuause it is similar to WRITE in that the object is only desroyed if the
object is at the same or higher level than the subject. Thus, information can only flow
upwards with this process.
4) In order for the covert channel on slide 5 to work, the CREATE must only create an
object if the object does not already exist. WRITE must obey the *-Property and READ must
obey the Simple Security Property.
5) The DESTROY statement is there so that the process can be looped.
6) The processes are the same. The only thing different is whether or not the object is
already present at the higher tier which would effect the output signal.
7) SL does the same thing in both cases because it is the experiment to see what the 
unknown input is (whether or not the object is present in SH) by look at the results
(either 0 or 1). Yes, it must do the same thing in both cases or there would be no need
to run the process in the first place, as the result would already be known.
8) SH does different things because those are the two possible scenarios. If they were
both the same, the program would output the same thing every time, which defeats the 
purpose of running this particular process in the first place.
9) If something from a higher tier transmits information to a lower tier, than there is a
flow of information downwards which is in violation of the metapolicy that information
may only travel upwards.

****************
** Lecture 14 **
****************

1) Two humans talking over coffee is not a covert channel because it is not happening
within the system.
2) No it is not a covert channel because the READ operation is being done by a subject
at the lower tier while the object is at the higher tier so it would not be possible to
transmit any information in this case.
3) The access to a high level resource sends information to the lower level resource by
indicating whether the resource being access is there or not.
4) The bit of information resides in the time elapsed between process p and q. Process q
consults the system clock to see how much time has elapse since the last schedule.
5) The bit of information resides in which direction the read head travels. Whether it
moves left or right depends on p's most recent read which could then be recorded by q.
6) The bit of information resides in l because the resulting value of l depends on the
value of h.
7) A termination channel might have low bandwith because the only information it needs
to record is whether the process terminates or not.
8) In order to implement a power channel, there must be a process consuming a more than
neglible amount of energy.
9) Practically any computer or computing device could give rise to a power channel since
processes require energy to carry out computations.

****************
** Lecture 15 **
****************

1) Covert channels could potential pose large threats because they can operate at thousands
of bits per second with no appreciable impact on system processing.
2) It would be infesible to eliminate every potential covert channel because then there
would potential functionality trade-offs.
3) One could response appropriately to a covert channel by eliminating it through the
system implemention, reduce the bandwith by introducing noise, or monitor it for patterns
of usage to determine if someone is trying to exploit it.
4) A convert storage channel exists in the file size attribute.
5) The sender can modify the size of the file by add or deleting data. The reciever can
then reference the size of the file.

****************
** Lecture 16 **
****************

1) There is no R under the CREATE operation under the FILE EXISTENCE attribute because
the system does not indicate whether the file was already present or just created.
2) An R and M in the same row of an SRMM table indicates a potential channel because
the sender (M) and receiver (R) both have access to the shared attribute and may
potentially be able to communication with one another.
3) If R and M are in the same column then this does not inducate that there is a 
potential covert channel because this does not show the sender and reciever being able to access the same attribute.
4) Someone may go through the trouble of creating an SRMM table to find potential covert
storage channels.
