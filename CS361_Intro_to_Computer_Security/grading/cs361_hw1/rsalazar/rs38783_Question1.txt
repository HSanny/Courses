Lecture 1.
	1Q. What uses of the term "security" are relevant to your everyday life?
		1A.
			Physical, Network and Computer Security are relevant to everyday life. Physical could be represented as locking your doors. Computer and Network security are used when surfing the web and running a anti-virus scan. 

	2Q. What do these have in common?
		2A.
			Besides having the word Security in the name. They all prevent potential malicious activity.

	3Q. Have you been a victim of lax security?
		3A.
			Yes, When I was younger my laptop received a few viruses.

	4Q. What is the likelihood that your laptop is infected? How did you decide?
		4A. 
			Not very likely. I haven't used it extensively in ~1 year. I also reguarly run virus scans and do not traverse to shady sites on it when I do use it.

	5Q.	What security measures do you employ on your laptop?
		5A.
			I use Microsoft Essentials and use common sense on what to do browse on the Internet.

	6Q. Do you think they are probably effective?
		6A.
			For the most part yes. 

	7Q.	Consider the quote from the FBI official on slide 10. Do you think it over 		states the case? Justify your answer. 
		7A.  
			I think it overstates the case. I think most of the country-shattering information is probably, hopefully, in private networks contained within facilities. Assuming that, it turns into both a cyber and physical problem rather than purely cyber.

	8Q. What is the importance in learning about computer security?
		8A.
			You learn how to better protect yourself in both a personal and professional workspace. Better protecting yourself / the company can lead to fewer crisis.

Lecture 2.
	1Q. Consider the five reasons given why security is hard. Can you think of other factors?
		1A.
			New malicious methods by attackers. There are no finite set of attacks attackers can use.

	2Q. Is there a systematic way to enumerate the "bad things" that might happen to a program? Why or why not?
		2A.
			No. Because there is an every changing list of exploits which would cause your list of "bad things" to constantly fluctuate. There might also be oversight regarding your system which could lower your estimation.


	3Q. Explain the asymmetry between the defender and attacker in security.
		3A.
			The defender has to protect against many different attackers of which can use a seemingly infinite different ways of attacking the system. The attacker only has to find one workable exploit.

	4Q. Examine the quotes From Morris and Chang. Do you agree? Why or why not?
		4A.
			Yes. There would always be new threats, some of which might of never been encountered before. This chaotic nature of this means that you never 100% safe. Unless you have no connection to the general population.

	5Q.	Explain the statement on slide 8 that a trade off is typically required.
		5A.
			Improving security could lead to a lower preferable experience in other goals. Improving security not lowers time but it can slightly affect other parts of the project, such as a security layer in the program which leads to performance or a password screen that decreases product usability.

Lecture 3.
	1Q. Define "risk"?
		1A.
			the possibility of a threat maliciously attacking a system using a certain exploit.

	2Q. Do you agree that software security is about managing risk?
		2A.
			Yes. Because risk is not conversationally possible to completely remove, you have to reduce the risk more damaging and /or likely to happen.

	3Q. Name and explain a risk you accept, one you avoid, one you mitigate, and one you transfer?
		3A.
			1. I accept the risk that one day the world will be hit by an asteroid. Because unless I turn into Bruce Willis I'm not going to be able to counteract that disaster.
			2. You avoid the risk of getting sent to jail by not committing a crime. Not committing a crime eliminates any chance of getting sent to jail.
			3. You can transfer a risk by getting a home security system. The thief would focus attention away from your house and towards your neighbors.
			4. You mitigate the risk by not carrying all your money in your wallet. By not carrying all your money in your wallet you reduce the total amount of money lost in case of a mugging.

	4Q. Evaluate annualized loss expectancy as a risk management tool.
		4A.
			It is good for a rough estimation. With the ALE you should also look at the individual risks to see one that might be dwarfed by a small percentage but could result in catastrophe.

	5Q.	List some factors relevant to rational risk assessment.
		5A.
			Technical, economical, psychological.

Lecture 4.
	1Q. Explain the key distinction between the lists on slides 2 and 3. 
		1A.
			The first list is the goals you wish to achieve while the other list is the methods you can use to achieve those goals.

	2Q. Consider your use of computing in your personal life. Which is most important: confidentiality, integrity, availability? Justify your answer.
		2A.
			It depends on the situation. In situations when I'm using my personal information, such as government sites I would want confidentiality. This is so people don't steal my identity. For using online storage, I would prefer availability so I would never be without a wanted file.

	3Q. What does it mean "to group and categorize data"?
		3A.
			You group data to prioritize certain groups over other. This way you can focus on protecting the more valuable information and reducing risk. 

	4Q. Why might authorizations change over time?
		4A.
			People may leave or get promoted. So they have to eliminate all authorizations or be able to access a higher priority group of data respectively.

	5Q.	Some of the availability questions seem to relate more to reliability than to security. How are the two related?
		5A.
			Both availability and reliability have the goal to keeping the system working in the most amount of time.

	6Q. In what contexts would authentication and non-repudiation be considered important?
		6A.
			They would be considered important when dealing with an online retailer. You would want non-repudiation to make sure transfers happen smoothly and a fulfilled and authentication to prevent fraud or phishing.

Lecture 5.
	1Q. Describe a possible meta policy for a cell phone network? A military database?
		1A.
			Cell phone - Encourage the selling of your phones
			Military database -  Prevent leaks to the general public

	2Q. Why do you need a policy if you have a metapolicy?
		2A.
			Metapolicy regards the goal. The Policy is needed to perform that goal. They are rules that you instill to perform that goal.

	3Q. Give three possible rules within a policy concerning students' academic records.
		3A.
			1. They can not be shown or given to a person with out the right identification.
			2. There cannot be any copies made of any records without the written record of the action and an appropriate request. 
			3. They cannot be altered without the right authentication.

	4Q. Could stakeholders' interest conflict in a policy? Give an example?
		4A.
			Yes, A stake holder might only be interested in the profits of a company, while the company might have a meta policy of safety. The metapolicy would lead to money being spent on safety items and or training, which would increase cost and be against the stake holder's interest.

	5Q.	For the example given involving student SSNs, state the likely metapolicy
		5A.
			Protect the confidentiality of student SSNs.

	6Q. Explain the statement: "IF you don't understand the metapolicy, it becomes difficult to justify and evaluate the policy."
		6A.
			The metapolicy is the goal you are trying to achieve. If you don't know what you are trying to achieve the policy, the rules you enforce, can seem a bit nonsensical.

Lecture 6.
	1Q. Why is the military security mainly about confidentiality? Are there also aspects of integrity and availability?
		1A.
			The Military does not want information to leak out. MLS does not have integrity and availability.


	2Q. Describe the major threat in our MLS thought experiment.
		2A.
			Information flowing down.

	3Q. Why do you think the proviso is there?
		3A.
			The thought up system is created for confidentiality only. This leads to huge vulnerabilities on the other two aspects, availability and Integrity.

	4Q. Explain the form of the labels we're using.
		4A.
			There's two parts the level and category. The levels are Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret. The categories are Crypto, Nuclear, Janitorial, Personnel, etc.

	5Q.	Why do you suppose we're not concerned with how the labels get there?
		5A.
			The labels are assigned by subjects with the necessary authorization to create a file.

	6Q. Rank the facts listed on slide 6 by sensitivity.
		6A.
			1. The Normandy invasion is scheduled for June 6.
			2. The British have broken the German Enigma codes.
			3. Col. Jones just got a raise.
			4. Col. Smith didn't get a raise.
			5. The base softball team has a game tomorrow at 3 pm.
			6. The cafeteria is serving chopped beef on toast today.
	
	7Q. Invent labels for documents containing each of those facts.
		7A.
			1. Top-Secret {}
			2. Secret{Crypto}
			4. Confidential {Personnel}
			4. Confidential {Personnel}
			5. Unclassified {Personnel}
			6. Unclassified {Janitorial}

	8Q. Justify the rules for "mixed" documents.
		8A.
			When you have mixed documents you protect the information at the highest hierarchical level and protect all categories of information it contains.

Lecture 7.
	1Q. Document labels are stamped on the outside. How are "labels" affixed to humans?
		1A.
			You design clearances or authorization levels.

	2Q. Explain the difference in semantics of labels for documents and labels for humans.
		2A.
			A label on a document is the set of information that is held within the document. A label on a human is what type of information we trust that individual to access.

	3Q. In the context of computers what do you think are the analogues of documents? Of humans?
		3A.
			Documents are computer files and the humans are the processes.

	4Q. Explain why the Principle of Least Privilege makes sense.
		4A.	
			It makes sense because if people are only exposes to what they need, you lessen the degree of information that they have over the system. This results in no one person having to much information of the system unless absolutely necessary.

	5Q.	For each of the pairs of labels on slide 6, explain why the answers in the third column do or do not make sense.
		5A.
			they all make sense. The first one has an individual read from a lower level label with the same category which is allowed. The second is the opposite in that it can't read from a higher level label with the same category. The third one has a higher level label and the objects category's are a set with in the subject's categories.

Lecture 8.
	1Q. Why do you think we introduce the vocabulary terms: objects, subjects, actions?
		1A.
			To keep the terminology concurrent between multiple examples and/or situations.

	2Q. Prove that dominates is a partial order (reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric).
		2A.
			transitive
			If Top Secret dominates Secret and Secret dominates Unclassified
			then Top Secret dominates Unclassified

			reflexive
			All the levels dominates themselves.

			antisymmetric
			top Secret dominates Secret and Secret doesn't not dominate TopSecret. Therefore it is not symmetric


	3Q. Show that dominates is not a total order.
		3A.
			Labels classified under different labels might not dominate each other, e.g. TopSecret{Crypto} and TopSecret{Personnel}

	4Q. What would have to be true for two labels to dominate each other?
		4A.
			They have exactly the same properties.

	5Q.	State informally what the Simple Security property says.
		5A.
			A subject can only read an object only if his level as above that of the documents and the documents categories are a subset of his authorized subset.

	6Q. Explain why it's "only if" and not "if and only if."
		6A.
			if and only if implies that is sufficient on its own. There might be other rules or labels we don't know about that will lead to a subject being denied. in other words it is not a guarantee.

Lecture 9.
	1Q. Why isn't Simple Security enough to ensure confidentiality?
		1A.
			It doesn't prevent abuses with the write command.

	2Q. Why do we need constraints on write access?
		2A.
			High level subjects could leak information by writing below them.

	3Q. What is it about computers, as opposed to human beings, that makes that particularly important?
		3A.
			Humans can be trusted to not leak things, While processes could be infected with malware that give way to a vulnerability.	

	4Q. State informally what the *-Property says.
		4A.
			A subject can only write to an object that has a higher or equal level and a subset of the subjects categories.

	5Q.	What must be true for a subject to have both read and write access to an object?
		5A.
			They must have exactly the same labels.

	6Q. How could we deal with the problem that General(top secret) can't send orders to the private(Unclassified)?
		6A.
			You have to implement a way to write down and therefore adding a new vulnerability. 

	7Q. Isn't it a problem that a corporal can overwrite the war plan? Suggest how we might deal with that.
		7A.
			Use a system to protect integrity.

Lecture 10.
	1Q. Evaluate changing a subject's level(up or down) in light of weak tranquility.
		1A.
			You can change a subject's level in a way that doesn't violate the spirit of the security policy so for subjects that would mean down.

	2Q. Why not just use strong tranquility all the time?
		2A.
			The authorizations and levels of objects /subjects are never set in stone. People can get demoted/Promoted and documents declassified.

	3Q. Explain why lowering the level of an object may be dangerous.
		3A.
			That is a downward flow of information. There is a chance that something that you don't want to be known might be presented with that file.

	4Q. Explain what conditions must hold for a downgrade (lowering object level) to be secure.
		4A.
			It does not hold confidential information that does not want to be conveyed to the lowered level.

Lecture 11.
	1Q. Suppose you wanted to build a (library) system in which all subjects had read access to all files, but write access to none of them. What levels could you give to subjects and objects?
		1A.
			Subjects level - Readers
			Objects level - Books

			Set of levels in desc. order
			Readers
			TempLevel
			Books

	2Q. Why wouldn't you usually build an access control matrix for a BLP system?
		2A.
			There could be a lot of different labels that the matrix itself grows to be to big to work with.

Lecture 12.
	1Q. Suppose you had hierarchical levels L, H with L < H, but only had one category A. Draw the lattice.
		1A.
			......H{A}......
			...H{}...L{A}...
			......L{}.......


	2Q. Given any two labels in a BLP system, what is the algorithm for finding their LUB and GLB?
		2A.
			LUB - Do a breadth first search moving upward until you find one that doesn't flow upwards in the lattice.
			GLB -  Do a breadth first search moving downward and use the last object you visit.


	3Q. Explain why upward flow in the lattice really is the metapolicy for BLP.
		3A.
			The metapolicy is to prevent information flowing down.

Lecture 13.
	1Q. Explain how the BLP rules are supposed to enforce the metapolicy in the example on slide 1.
		1A.
			They do not allow the lower subject to read above his level and the higher subject can not write down.	

	2Q. Argue that the READ and WRITE operations given satisfy BLP.
		2A.
			They follow the simple security and *-property rules so yes.

	3Q. Argue that the CREATE and DESTROY operations given satisfy BLP.
		3A.
			They are just certain situations of the WRITE operation so they do fall in line with BLP.

	4Q. What has to be true for the covert channel on slide 5 to work?
		4A.
			The Create method does nothing if the object is already created and the Read returns 0 if you are not allowed to read it.

	5Q.	Why is the DESTROY statement there?
		5A.
			To clear up the object, so that when they transfer the next bit they have a clean slate.

	6Q. Are the contents of any files different in the two paths?
		6A.
			No, but the label for F0 is on the first one it is in higher security level and in the second it is in the lower security level

	7Q. Why does SL do the same thing in both cases? Must it?
		7A.
			It has no way of knowing if the what Sh has done, until after it does the series of actions.

	8Q. Why does SH do different things? Must it?
		8A.
			Yes because if it didn't do different things it wouldn't of been able to send down information.

	9Q. Justify the statement on slide 7 that begins: "If SL ever sees..."
		9A.
			Depending on what Sh does it could read a 0 or a 1. If it keeps track of Sh's responses it could group together messages such as strings, keys in the form of binary.


Lecture 14.
	1Q. Explain why "two humans users talking over coffee is not a covert channel." 
		1A. 
			They are not subjects within the system. 

	2Q.Is the following a covert channel? Why or Why not?
			Send 0            |          Send 1
		-------------------------------------------
		    Write(SH,F0,0)    |     Write(SH,F0,1)
		    Read(SL,F0)       |     Read(SL,F0)
 
		2A.
			No because both paths result in the Read responding with 0.

	3Q. Where does the bit of information transmitted "reside" in Covert Channel #1?
		3A. 
			In the time lapse of the availability of a certain file. 

	4Q. In Covert Channel #2? 
		4A.
			The timing of the internal clock system.

	5Q.	In Covert Channel #3?
		5A.
			The state of the Disk drive the computer is using.

	6Q. In Covert Channel #4?
		6A.
			You use a conditional to change a lower security variable depending on a high security level variable.


	7Q. Why might a termination channel have low bandwidth?
		7A.
			You have to start and stop computation which take a bit of time.

	8Q. What would have to be true to implement a power channel?
		8A.
			There is a noticeable amount of energy spent that could be variable to a high security program.

	9Q. For what sort of devices might power channels arise?
		9A.
			Smart Phones, or temperature regulators.


Lecture 15.
	1Q.Explain why covert channels, while appearing to have such a low band-width, can potentially be very serious threats.
		1A.
			They can move important information, such as personal information or keys, to unwanted destinations such as over the Internet. 

	2Q. Why would it be infeasible to eliminate every potential covert channel?
		2A.
			There are a lot of different vulnerabilities with in the system.

	3Q. If detected, how could one respond appropriately to a covert channel?
		3A.
			Eliminate the channel. Reduce the bandwidth or monitor channel to check if someone is using aka intrusion detection.

	4Q. Describe a scenario in which a covert storage channel exists.
		4A.
			If the sender and receiver can read one attribute of a file such as existence, size, date created, etc. They must also have to have access to a time reference.


	5Q. Describe how this covert storage channel can be utilized by the sender and receiver.
		5A.
			They can set the attribute to a certain value during a certain time to transfer bits from the sender to the receiver.

Lecture 16.
	1Q.Why wouldn't the "create" operation have an R in the SRMM for the "file existence" attribute?
		1A.
			Because you create the file it is more of a modification than a read.


	2Q.Why does an R and M in the same row of an SRMM table indicate a potential channel?
		2A.
			That means that that is possible to read and modify from the same attribute. That means that programs can manipulate them into providing information to another channel.

	3Q.If an R and M are in the same column of an SRMM table, does this also indicate a potential covert channel? Why or why not?
		3A.
			No Because the column's are the methods that you use across different attributes. So there is not way to create a channel with no target attribute, using storage covert channel.

	4Q. Why would anyone want to go through the trouble to create an SRMM table?
		4A.
			To systematically track and deal with covert channels.
