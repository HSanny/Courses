Lecture 17
1. Yes, because BLP as a MLS system can necessarily be written as an NI policy.
2. A can interfere with A and B can interfere with B.
3. Theoretically, no. NI dictates that interferences must only flow up.
4. If the NI policy is A ? B, then A must be lower or equal in level to B.

Lecture 18
1. NI is more like a metapolicy than a policy because it defines a general action for general member within a system and doesn't take into account subjects or objects or other system specifics. 
2. l1, l2, l3, , lk
3. NI is difficult to prove for realistic systems because in real systems there are lots of low-level interferences. Unless you let those slide, it's hard to call a system NI.

Lecture 19
1. Integrity can mean who is allowed to modify data, how to separate and protect assets, how to detect and correct erroneous changes to data, and how authorizations change over time.
2. Because software from a well-known company is probably more trustworthy than the freeware version for producing and modifying data.
3. Separation of duty means splitting up parts of a critical task to be completed by different subjects. Separation of function requires that one individual can't perform two different critical functions. 
4. Auditing allows you to assign responsibility for or restore the integrity of compromised data.
5. In commercial settings, the amount of people working on a project together and the nature of the data makes integrity a larger concern.
6. Online banking.

Lecture 20
1. A highly reliable piece of information with little sensitivity would be the sun is a star. It has been well-researched and documented and is therefore reliable, but knowledge of it is not in any way dangerous. An unreliable piece of information with high sensitivity would be a rumor of an invasion. Maybe less likely, but a very important piece of information. 
2. Row 1: Because label 1 has a higher level in the same category, S1 > S2.
Row 2: Because label 1 has a lower level than label 2, S1 does not dominate S2.
Row 3: Because label 1 has a higher level, S1 > S2. 
3. H ? L
4. They're not related to one another; you need different sets of labels for confidentiality and integrity for subjects within a system.

Lecture 21
1. Because the properties defined to use the labels for integrity are the opposite of the properties for BLP.
2. Because neither Subj3 nor Obj3 dominates the other.
3. No.

Lecture 22
1. The assumption is that subjects will pass up bad information that they have read.
2. No, because they are immediately downgraded so that they don't pass on bad information if they read bad information.
3. The subject has the common sense to filter out bad information. 
4. Trustworthy enough to read information below their levels and not pass it on.

Lecture 23
1. They both label things in development, but SD is for confidentiality and ID is for integrity.
2. System controllers need the ability to downgrade because otherwise programs could never be taken from the development phase into the use phase.
3. Yes.
4. Weak tranquility: labels can change as long as the change does not violate the metapolicy.

Lecture 24
1. There are concerns specific to commercial security that aren't addressed or prioritized by military security. These concerns are focused on commercial security.
2. A constrained data item would be the balance of a bank account, a user's personal information for an account. 
3. An unconstrained data item would be business cards at a business or candy at the bank.
4. Certification ensures that a static state is valid; enforcement ensures that an operation maintains a valid state. 
5. On Amazon, a user can purchase an item. 

Lecture 25
1. Because American Airlines and United Airlines are competitors, so they are within the same conflict class.
2. Yes, because GM and Microsoft are not within the same conflict class and the second access is still only for GM.
3. GM's, Bank of America's, Wells Fargo's, Citicorp's, and Microsoft's.
4. While BLP has labels that include category and clearance level, Chinese Wall is more concerned with the category of the company. Permissions also change dynamically dependent on the past history of accesses. 

Lecture 26 
1. Rather than assigning individual permissions to each subject, subjects are given a role which comes with certain permissions.
2. Authorized roles are the roles that a subject can take on, active roles are the roles that a subject does take on.
3. Role authorization is making certain that the role a subject is filling is an authorized role; transaction authorization is making certain that any transaction a subject makes is one that their active role is authorized to make.
4. Standard access control policies are more difficult and require individual permission assignment, are less flexible in terms of what a subject may do without having to change its identity.

Lecture 27
1. For systems with large numbers of subjects and objects, an ACM would be very large. Also in real systems, most subjects don't have any access to objects. 
2. Capabilities, Access Control List, and implicit storage.

Lecture 28
1. For the receiver to interpret the data, both parties must have an agreement on which bit answer signifies which real answer.
2. Quantification of the information content of the message allows you to determine things like how quickly a message may be transmitted or what is required, hardware or software, to transmit the message. 
3. If the sender and receiver do not have shared knowledge and an agreed encoding scheme, then they will be unable to interpret one another's messages and the communication will be essentially meaningless.
4. It would add extra information to the stream to be communicated, and any extra information may confuse the actual message. 
5. 0; there's no need to communicate information if the answer is already known. 

Lecture 29
1. N bits, 4 bits, 7 bits
2. It depends on how much information in the message is unknown by the receiver. The more possibilities for when the attack will come as far as the receiver knows, the more content will need to be communicated. 
3. 4 bits, because each time you receive a bit, you are splitting the search space in half. For 16 possibilities, you can only divide the list in half 4 times.
4. log2(256) = 8 bits
5. In most scenarios you don't know how many possible messages can be sent, so the use of binary will be unhelpful in the search process.

Lecture 30 
1. Bit can either mean a binary digit or a continuous quantity that is a measure of information content.
2.

M1	001

M7	111
3. If for every 1000 messages 955 of them are M10, then 5 are other messages. M10 takes one bit of information where the other messages take 5 bits. So on average, 995 1 bit messages + 5 5 bit messages /1000 messages = 1.02 bits per message.
4. If you have an idea of which messages will be the most common, you can give those messages the smallest codes. This will make the average sent message smaller.

6. An optimal encoding would be the best possible encoding for a language, and it would mean much more efficient communications.

3. Because otherwise the message cannot be correctly interpreted.
4. Lossless encoding schemes are desirable because lossless encoding schemes are capable of transmitting the entire original message.
5. Morse code is not streaming: there must be breaks in the encoding in order to accurately purvey the message.

Lecture 32
1. h = log2(8) = 3
2. h = -(4/5log2(4/5) + 1/5log2(1/5)) = 0.72
3. Knowing the entropy of a language allows you to determine the amount of bits used in the best possible encoding, which is useful for efficiency.

Lecture 33
1. The expectations presented on slide 3 are extrapolations from the given probabilities of a head or tail: HH is (¾ * ¾), HT is (¾ * ¼ ) You then multiply these probabilities by the number of coin flips to receive the expected number of each appearance.
2. Take the expected number of each result and multiply it by the umber of bits that are needed to encode the result, then add those up for all of the results.

6. Given 20 rolls:
12 are 1 or 2
6 are 3 or 4
1 is 5
1 is 6

12 * 1 + 6 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 *3 = 12 + 12 + 2 + 3 = 29
29/20 = 1.45 average bits
My encoding does 1.45 average bits to the naï method's 3 average bits.
