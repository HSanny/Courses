Lecture 17:
1. Yes, because BLP allows all flow upwards, where as non-interference can specify that certain levels can only communicate with other certain levels so A BLP is always a non-interference but a non-interference is not always a BLP
2. A cannot interfere with B and B cannot interfere with A
3. No, because if there is absolutely no interference then there is nothing a high subject can do that a lower subject can see and therefore no covert channel can exist
4. A is low and B is high because A can interfere with B

Lecture 18:
1. Because there are no specific rules about objects or actions
2. L can see any of the l functions (l2,l3,...,lk)
3. There are too many interferences, most attributes that interfere are very low level of abstraction, and many interferences are benign

Lecture 19:
1. It signifies the amount of trustworthiness assigned to any given object or subject. In commercial settings, it means you won't get ripped off, in a classified setting, it means you are less likely to leak informations, etc...
2. Because the commercial software has more integrity. It is less likely to be malicious software that could harm your computer and that integrity is more important than the extra cost
3. Separation of Duty means more than 1 person is required for a critical task, where as Separation of Function means 1 person is not allowed to do multiple critical tasks
4. It keeps careful records so that responsibilities are always accounted for
5. You don't want the user side and producer side of a program to overlap and you want it to be able to shift from producer to user easily
6. A bank account. Other people being able to see your account could be bad, but others being able to modify your account would be much worse

Lecture 20:
1. A general professor would be more reliable but less sensitive where as an intern for a classified project would be not as reliable but more sensitive
2. Expert is more trusworthy than Student so it dominates, Novice is not as trustworthy as Expert so it does not dominate, and student is more trustworthy than novice so it dominates
3. H |-> L (high can interfere with low, but low cannot interfere with high)
4. They need different labels for each because confidentiality and integrity are not necessarily related to each other

Lecture 21:
1. You could essentially change the direction of the arrows on one model and you would then have the other model. They are the exact opposite of the other in terms of information flow direction
2. Because although they are the same level, neither ones' list of subjects dominates the other, and if neither dominates the other then there is neither read nor write access allowed
3. No, access is allowed only if both requirements are met

Lecture 22:
1. That reading less credible information automatically makes you less credible as a subject
2. There is little trust in the subjects because once you read bad information you are instantly considered non credible
3. That the subject has enough common sense to filter out any bad information
4. Subjects are considered more trustworthy because any accidental low-credibility read does not instantly label me as non credible

Lecture 23:
1. They are both development roles
2. So that can object can be switched from development to production
3. Yes, they have the highest level of confidentiality and integrity
4. Weak tranquility because it does not go against the security policy of the system

Lecture 24:
1. To address the security concerns that a commercial setting faces as opposed to a military setting
2. Bank balances, checks, etc...
3. The candy bowl at the bank counter
4. The certification rules are the security rules about integrity verification where as the enforcement rules are the security systems mechanisms to enforce those certification rules
5. A normal user at a bank cannot cut his own large cashier's check

Lecture 25:
1. They are competing companies and the consultant may have confidential information from American that he could share with United
2. Yes, because Microsoft is not in the same conflict class as GM
3. Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citicorp because they are not in the same conflict classes as GM and Microsoft
4. Access rights change dynamically depending on the history of accesses

Lecture 26:
1. It is much easier to manage several roles than a million specific users that share these roles
2. Authorized roles are roles a user is permitted to fill where as active roles are roles the subject currently employs
3. Role authorization requires a subject's active role to be one of its authorized roles whereas transaction authorization requires any transaction a subject does to be a transaction allowed by one of the subject's active roles
4. They are not as appropriate for a large organization because there are too many individual users, multiple roles for one user, and actions are more sprecific than read or write

Lecture 27:
1. In a realistic system most subjects don't have access to most objects
2. An access control list (ACL), a capability-based system, and an implicit series of rules (no proper name)

Lecture 28:
1. The receiver must know how to interpret the sender's answer
2. So that the sender and receiver have more knowledge on how to interpret a message
3. Because otherwise no communication can occur
4. Because that is less efficient than using Information Theory
5. 1, because the answer to a yes or no question can be interpreted as 1 bit, and he won't need to know what the bit means because he already knows the answer

Lecture 29:
1. n-bit: n-bits, single decimal digit: 4 bits, 2 digit decimal number: 7 bits, attack at dawn: depends
2. Because the amount of different possibilities means there is that many messages requiring log2 of the number of possible messages
3. 4 bits, because that can identify 16 possible messages by interpreting the 4 bits as a binary number
4. log2 of 256 = 8 bits
5. Because most circumstances don't have a set pool of possible messages

Lecture 30:
1. A binary digit is discrete whereas a quantity of information is continuous
2.  m0 = 000	m4 = 100
	m1 = 001	m5 = 101
	m2 = 010	m6 = 110
	m3 = 011	m7 = 111
3. Because 995 times it only takes 1 bit to send the message and 5 times it will take one of the 5 bit messages
4. Messages that have a higher probability can be given more efficient bit counts
5.  m1 = 0	  m3 = 101
	m2 = 100  m4 = 110 (all 25% chance)
6. That it is the best possible encoding for this language

Lecture 31:
1. 24680462
2.  1: 0
	2: 10
	3: 101
	4: 110
	5: 111
	6: 1111
3. So that there is only one way to decode and therefore the correct information will be decoded
4. So that you do not lose any information
5. Because Morse Code is not streaming (there is a break between each letter)

Lecture 32:
1. log2 of 8 = 3
2. -(4/5 * log2(4/5) + 1/5 * log2(1/5)) = .72192809488
3. Entropy gives us a lower limit on encoding efficiency meaning you can see how efficient any encoding is

Lecture 33:
1. Because a Heads is more likely than a Tails so we expect an HH to happen 9/16 of the time and a TT only 1 out of every 16 times
2. Because the most common occurrence is a TT which is only 0 so you are therefore getting .5 bits per answer. This allows the total number of bits sent to be less than the number of flips
3.  m1 = 000	m4 = 011
	m2 = 001	m5 = 100
	m3 = 010	m6 = 101
4. 1&2: 6/10 3&4: 3/10 5&6: 1/10
	-(6/10 * log2(6/10) + 3/10 * log2(3/10) + 1/10 * log2(1/10)) = 1.29546184424
5.  m1 = 0		m4 = 1110
	m2 = 10		m5 = 11110
	m3 = 110	m6 = 11111
6. 6/10 * 1.5 + 3/10 * 3.5 + 1/10 * 5 = 2.45
	2.45 is less than 3 and therefore it is more efficient than the naive encoding
