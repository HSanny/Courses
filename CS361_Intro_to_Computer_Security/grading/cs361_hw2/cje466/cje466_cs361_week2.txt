Questions Week 2


***************************************
Lecture 17
***************************************
1. If a computer system complies with the BLP model, does it necessarily comply with 
   non-interference? Why or why not?
   -> No since NI is more strict then BLP by specifying the information flow

2. What would the NI policy be for a BLP system with subjects: 
   A at (Secret:Crypto), B at (Secret: Nuclear)?
   -> Neither dominates one another

3. Can covert channels exist in an NI policy? Why or why not?
  -> No because the NI specifies the direction in which the information is flowing

4. If the NI policy is A− > B, in a BLP system what combinations of thelevels “high” and “low” 
    could A and B have?
    A(Low) is dominated by B(High or could be Low also) 



***************************************
Lecture 18
***************************************
1. Why do NI policies better resemble metapolicies than policies?
 -> Because it specifies in a more general way how information should flow
   in a system vs rules.

2. What would be L’s view of the following actions: h1, l1, h2, h3, . . . , hj,l2, l3, . . . , lk
 -> L's view should only be L1,..,Lk

3. What is difficult about proving NI for realistic systems?
 -> Its difficult to prova that the low level system doesn't have acces to anything that the high level system does. There could be an unknow cover channel.

Lecture 19
***************************************
	1. Explain the importance of integrity in various contexts.
	-> Security Definition: 
	   Integrity: who can write or modify information.

	   General Definition:
	   Integrity: the quality of being honest and having strong moral 
	   principles; moral uprightness.

	   Wheather is writting data or just being honest we can fullfill the deinition
	   of integrity within our definitions. Integrity is what bring success to entities 
	   and their reputations. When we buy a megazine like the example on the slides we buy 
	   megazines based on the reputation of the megazine's publisher because we believe in 
	   their information being valid.


	2. Why would a company or individual opt to purchase commercial software
	rather than download a similar, freely available version?

	->  Well let's think about it. A certified application/software may have more
		integrity than freeware downloaded from the internet. Plus if you buy the 
		software you hold some level of thrust to the company based on reputation.

	3. Explain the difference between separation of duty and separation of function.
    -> Separation of function: A single subject cannot complete a complementary role
       in a critical function. Separation of Duty: several different objects must be
       involved when completing a critical task. To conserve integrity one must do one's 
       job only and not someone elses just to make sure the check and balance is ensure.

	4. What is the importance of auditing in integrity contexts?
	-> It's more like a check and balance tool. We wouldn't want a teller at the bank
	   to be stealing money during the day and cover it up at night as an auditer. So we have seperate entities to make sure integrity is being keot.

	5. What are the underlying ideas that raise the integrity concerns of Lipner?
	-> User will not write their own programs, the process of development should be seperated by tester and 	developers. There should be a special process to move code to production. To ensure that we are not 	writeting software that will put us at an advantage.

	6. Name a common scenario where integrity would be more important than
	confidentiality.
	-> If I had billions of dollars in the back I would rather have integrity in the amount of money I have
		without much more importance to confidentiality since I am sure if i was a millioner it would be 
		well known.


***************************************
Lecture 20
***************************************
	1. Give examples of information that is highly reliable with little sensitivity
	and information that is not so highly reliable but with greater sensitivity.
	->highly reliable with little sensitivity: An expert in computer giving her oppinion
	  in how to make the best bbq. highly reliable but with greater sensitivity the computer expert
	  giving his oppinion on how to improve computer performance.

	2. Explain the dominates relationships for each row in the table on slide 4.
	->An Expert dominates a student and the subset of each subject are the same. Expert in physics can
	  dominates a student in physics. A novice is not a highly credable therefore it doesn't dominate an 
	  expert on that matter. A student in art has a higher level of trustiness then a novice.

	3. Construct the NI policy for the integrity metapolicy.
	->Don't allow bad information to infiltrate into the good information. 

	4. What does it mean that confidentiality and integrity are “orthogonal issues?”
	-> That it can be enforce apart from each other
	-> Security itself is hard. It's hard to uphold the 3 principles (Confidentiality, Integrity and  
	   Accesability) is a system so we often end up adapting what it means to be a secure system. 
	   So either you can be extremely confidential but lack integrity or have total integrity and lack confidentiality. We often end up implementing a little bit of both.


***************************************
Lecture 21
***************************************
	1. Why is Biba Integrity called the “dual” of the BLP model?
	->Simple integrity means that the subject can only read objects at it's own integrity and below.
	The integrity * property meanst that a subject can only write objects with its own integrity and up.
	This means that the integrity cannot be put at risk byreading bad info and the other way around.
	It aims to keep information from flowing up in integrity.

	2. Why in the ACM on slide 5 is the entry for Subj3 - Obj3 empty?
	->Because even tho they are at the same integrity level the the object's set is not a subset
	  of the subjects set.

	3. If a subject satisfies confidentiality requirements but fails integrity 
	requirements of an object, can the subject access the object?
	-> No if the definision of access includes READ/WRITE because bad data would be infiltrating into the 
	system possibly.



***************************************
Lecture 22
***************************************
	1. What is the assumption about subjects in Biba’s low water mark policy?
	->Biba’s Low Water Mark Policy has the following two rules:
      1 If s reads o, then i 0(s) = min(i (s), i (o)), where i 0(s) is the
         subject’s new integrity level after the read.
      2 Subject s can write to object o only if i (o) <= i (s).

      Any subject can read any object, regardless of integrity levels.
      Subject s can write to object o only if i (o) >= i (s).

	2. Are the subjects considered trustworthy?
	->Depends on the integrity level.

	3. Does the Ring policy make some assumption about the subject that the
	LWM policy does not?
	-> Any subject can read any object, regardless of integrity levels.
      Subject s can write to object o only if i (o) >= i (s).

	4. Are the subjects considered trustworthy? 
	->Yes.


***************************************
Lecture 23
***************************************
	1. Are the SD and ID categories in Lipner’s model related to each other?
	-> SD Development (confidentiality levels) ID development (integrity)

	2. Why is it necessary for system controllers to have to ability to downgrade?
	->Because it is necessary to be able to move code from development into 
	  production. 

	3. Can system controllers modify development code/test data?
	-> Yes, they meet the integrity and confidentialy requirements.

	4. What form of tranquility underlies the downgrade ability?
	-> Weak tranquility


***************************************
Lecture 24
***************************************
	1. What is the purpose of the four fundamental concerns of Clark andWilson?
	->Integrity can ve adapted to yield a workable comercial policy.
	  1. Authentication
	  2. Audit
	  3. Well-formed transaction
	  4. Separation of duty

	2. What are some possible examples of CDIs in a commercial setting?
	-> Constraint Data Items (CDIs) objects whose integrity is protected]
	   -people's SSN, Bank Info

	3. What are some possible examples of UDIs in a commercial setting?
	-> Unconstraint Data Item (UDIs) the object is not covered by the integrity policy
		-Someone's address

	4. What is the difference between certification and enforcement rules?
	->Certification is whats required in order for a proccess to move on and enforcement
	  act like rules and we can not continue the proccess until the rules are met.

	5. Give an example of a permission in a commercial setting.
	-> The release of a new software, if done properly if would have gone through various steps 
	from development to testing to productiom. That itself asks like a check and balance.


***************************************
Lecture 25
***************************************
	1. Why would a consultant hired by American Airlines potentially have a
	breach of confidentiality if also hired by United Airlines?
	->Yes because of the recidual information that the hired may have with them could be used 
	against the other to gain some advantage. 

	2. In the example conflict classes, if you accessed a file from GM, then 
	subsequently accessed a file from Microsoft, will you then be able to access
	another file from GM?
	->Yes because they are part of diferent company groups

	3. Following the previous question, what companies’ files are available for
	access according to the simple security rule?
	->Any companies's files who are not within the company group of the company you work for.

	4. What differences separate the Chinese Wall policy from the BLP model?


***************************************
Lecture 26
***************************************
	1. What benefits are there in associating permissions with roles, rather than
	subjects?
	-> 

	2. What is the difference between authorized roles and active roles?
	->Active role means that is a role that person is quilified of doing some job vs authorized rule
	  means its something that a person is capable of doing but might not be the most adequate person.
	  Role Authorization: a subject can execute a transaction only if the transaction is authorized for one the subjects' active roles

	3. What is the difference between role authorization and transaction authorization?
	-> Role Authorization: a subject can execute a transaction only if the transaction is authorized for one 
	   the subjects' active roles. Transaction authorization a subject can execute a transaction only if the 
	   transaction is authorized for one of the subjects' active roles.

	4. What disadvantages do standard access control policies have when compared
	to RBAC?
	 -> RBAC associates permisissions with functions/roles/jobs within an organization


***************************************
Lecture 27
***************************************
	1. Why would one not want to build an explicit ACM for an access control
	system?
	->Storing the matrix explicitly is expensive and usually unecessary.

	2. Name, in order, the ACM alternatives for storing permissions with objects,
	storing permissions with subjects and computing permissions on the fly.
	->1. Maintain a set of rules to compute access permissions
      2. Store the permisions wih objects
      3. Store the permisions with subjects

***************************************
Lecture 28
***************************************
1. What must be true for the receiver to interpret the answer to a “yes” or “no”
  question?
  ->They both agree to some amount of information and the significance.
   They must be shaing some type of encoding and decoding practices

2. Why would one want to quantify the information content of a message?
  -> Just to have an idea of the amount of information that can be transmitted
    through each specific cover channel

3. Why must the sender and receiver have some shared knowledge and an
  agreed encoding scheme?
  ->To know what to encode how to encode it and when to stop.  Reduce ineficiency
  and have some type of norms.

4. Why wouldn’t the sender want to transmit more data than the receiver needs
  to resolve uncertainty?
  ->To make communication easy and efficient and resolve any uncertanty regarding 

5. If the receiver knows the answer to a question will be “yes,” how many bits
  of data quantify the information content? Explain.
  ->one bit would be enough since you can represent 1 and 0 as a yes and no.


***************************************
Lecture 29
***************************************
1. How much information is contained in each of the first three messages from
slide 2?

-> 1. n-bits
   2. 10 possibilities can be represented with 4 bits minimun
   3. 8 bits to represent any number with 2 digits 

2. Why does the amound of information contained in “The attack is at dawn”
depend on the receiver’s level of uncertainty?

3. How many bits of information must be transmitted for a sender to send one
of exactly 16 messages? Why?
  -> 4 bits of information since its 4 different messages.

4. How much information content is contained in a message from a space of
256 messages?
 -> Log(256)(Based 2) = 8 bits

5. Explain why very few circumstances are ideal, in terms of sending information
content.
 ->Because of the difficulty of finding a common coding schema that both can sgare 
   with a small amount of uncertanty.

***************************************
Lecture 30
***************************************
1. Explain the difference between the two connotations of the term “bit.”

	m7 |    1100
	m8 |    1110

3. Explain why the encoding on slide 5 takes 995 + (5 * 5) bits.
>Because of the difficulty of finding a common coding schema that both can sgare 
   with a small amount of uncertanty.

4. How can knowing the prior probabilities ofmessages lead to amore efficient
  encoding?
  >Because of the difficulty of finding a common coding schema that both can sgare

5. Construct an encoding for 4 possible messages that is worse than the naive
encoding.
>Because of the difficulty of finding a common coding schema that both can sgare 
   with a small amount of uncertanty.

***************************************
1. Name a string in the language consisting of positive, even numbers.
  -> "2468"
2. Construct a non-prefix-free encoding for the possible rolls of a 6-sided die.
>Because of the difficulty of finding a common coding schema that both can sgare 
   with a small amount of uncertanty.
3. Why is it necessary for an encoding to be uniquely decodable?
 >Because of the difficulty of finding a common coding schema that both can sgare 
   with a small amount of uncertanty.
4. Why is a lossless encoding scheme desirable?
>Because of the difficulty of finding a common coding schema that both can sgare 
   with a small amount of uncertanty.
5. Why doesn’t Morse code satisfy our criteria for encodings?
>Because of the difficulty of finding a common coding schema that both can sgare 
   with a small amount of uncertanty.


***************************************
Lecture 32
***************************************
1. Calculate the entropy of an 8-sided, fair die (all outcomes are equally likely).
->h = -(log 1/n) 
    = log n 
    = log 1/8 
    = log 8 
    = 3 bits to transmit result

2. If an unbalanced coin is 4 times more likely to yield a tail than a head, what
is the entropy of the language?
-> -(.25 x log(.25) + 1/(log(1))) = -(-.5 + 0)= 0.5

3. Why is knowing the entropy of a language important?
->Entropy sets a lower limit on encoding efficiency, measure the average 
information content of symbols. Overall provide a bound on the efficiency of any 
encoding.


***************************************
Lecture 33
***************************************
1. Explain the reasoning behind the expectations presented in slide 3.
   HH => 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16
   TH => 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16
   HT => 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16
   TT => 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16

2. Explain why the total expected number of bits is 27 in the example presented in slide 4.
 -> Total bits = count times the number of bits per code
     total: (1)9 + (2)(3)+ (3)(3) + (1)(3) = 27


3. What is the naive encoding for the language in slide 5?
  side     prob			code

	5      1/14    	  1000
	6	   1/14	      1010
4. What is the entropy of this language?
  -> -( 2*(1/14 * log (1/14)) + 2*(3/21 * log (3/21) + 2*(6/21 * log (6/21))

5. Find an encoding more efficient than the naive encoding for this language.

	5        5/21    	 110
	6		 6/21	     10

6. Why is your encoding more efficient than the naive encoding?
 -> Because of the the way it encodes the one that apears the most gets the shortest encode and so on.
