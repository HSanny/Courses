Lecture 17

1. no, because it could have a covert channel still
2. B -> A
3. no, because it doesn't allow for information to be read/written by someone not allowed
4. both: low and high. a: low, b:high. 

Lecture 18

1. because it states how information can flow from one to the other and not the other way around. There is nothing about which subjects can read/write or actions/objects at all. It is rules, not general overview
2. anything the H's actions may not affect. contents of file L, system flags, system clock 
3. there is always interferences. You need to be passing information all over the place, so it would be extremely difficult to limit that.  

Lecture 19
 
1. For news - want to make sure it is legitamite and someone just didn't make it up. For textbooks - make sure the research behind it is truth and someone didn't mess with contents.
2. for integrity reasons. A free version might be buggy, have viruses, etc. 
3. duty - many subjects are involved to complete a function, but with seperate function, the subject cannot complete complementary roles within that function. 
4. for the microsoft example, they need to make sure something doesn't get published unless it is supposed too/works correctly
5. Lipner doesn't want users to use outside software that might have integrity concerns, he also doesn't want applications published unless they undergo a rigerous process of auditing
6. the News. Everyone can read the news, but don't want people messing with the content

Lecture 20

1. news, rumors
2. expert dominates student, and both have physics. thus it dominates
   novice is not higher than expert
   student is higher than novice, and art is higher than null
3. information cannot flow up in integrity. L |-> H
4. they are not the same, we have to treat them different even though they might appear similar

Lecture 21

1. it is basically the twin. You can use both of these to secure a system too.
2. because neither dominates - there is a C in the objects
3. no, if you are satisfying both. 

Lecture 22

1. subjects integrity level can be changes - falls if reads low integrity info.
2. no
3. that the subjects won't use the information wrongly since everyone can read everything
4. yes

Lecture 23

1. The both 
2. so that software can move to production
3. yes system controllers have confidentiality of SP and SD with integrity of IP and ID
4. weak tranquility

Lecture 24
 
1. the purpose is to secure the system. making sure that one who is authorized, manipulates data only in a constrained way and it is logged.
2. for a bank, the bank accounts, user information
3. for a bank , numbers entered into the keyboard
4. certification - checks to see if valid and in state it should be in. enforcement - makes sure TPs cert. can run on CDI. The enforce the access. 
5. (manager, change information, {users name, users email, users address})

Lecture 25

1. They are competing airlines, thus the consultant could give one information about the other that doesn't need to be exchanged
2. yes
3. can access BoA, Wells Fargo or Citicorp - but only one
4. CWP is concerned with history and groups - its concerned about conflicts of interest

Lecture 26

1. give multiple people a role instead of giving every subject permissions. It is just easier. 
2. authorized - a user is allowed to fill these roles at some point but active roles, is what it currently occupies
3. role - checks actives role authorization for subject, while transaction checks to see if the transaction is authorized. 
4. in RBAC a subject can change roles more easily, you can also give multiple people the same role so you don't have to give everyone an individual role

Lecture 27

1. becomes very large
2. Access control list, capability-based,  "on the fly"

Lecture 28

1. sender and reciever much ahve some shared knowledge about which bit means what. They need to agree on an encoding scheme too.
2. so the receiver knows how much data it is looking for 
3. if they don't then the reciever might get the message wrong or incomplete
4. it is unecessary bandwidth
5. 1 bit. either a 1 or 0. 

Lecture 29

1. a. 2^n  
   b. 10
   c. 20
   d. 25*8
2. because the recievers uncertainity could be anything. If it is a yes no question, then one bit, if it could happen any time during the day it would be many bits
3. 4
4. 8
5. becuase there is a high level of uncertainty always basically

Lecture 30

1. a binary digit and a quantity of information. Bit2 is the amount of information, not just a 1 or 0.
2. 
  000
  001
  010
  100
  011
  110
  101
  111
3. 995 is the average that it will be 10. 5 is the other. The other 5 is the amount of bits.
4. so you can change the encoding to make a more frequent message a select bit
5. 0000000
   1000000
   0100000
   0010000
   0001111
   0000111
   0100001
   0101001
6. using a bit or two to represnet more frequent messages. 

Lecture 31

1. 12345678
2. 0,01,011,0111,01111,011111
3. if it isn't then there will be confusions and get wrong outcomes
4. you want lossless so you can recover the whole thing
5. because it is not prefix-free. there are ones that are prefixs for the others

Lecture 32

1. .9031 I did -(1/8log(1/8)+....+same) or can just do log(1/8)
2. .217 
3. we want to find the optimal, the closer to 1 the more optimal. 

Lecture 33

1. becuase that is how many total bits there are
2. 
  001
  010
  100
  101
  110
  111
3. 
  6/20,6/20,3/20,3/20,1/20,1/20
  .691
4. 
  if we combine and do 12, 34, 56 we could have
  0
  10
  110
  111

5. yes. 
6. Less bits
