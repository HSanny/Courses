Lecture 17

If a computer system complies with the BLP model, does it necessarily
comply with non-interference? Why or why not?
	Yes. non interference is just a set of rules objects can communicate with one another. A BLP system has that information.

What would the NI policy be for a BLP system with subjects: A at (Secret:
Crypto), B at (Secret: Nuclear)?
	In that example neither A nor B can interfere with one another
	
Can covert channels exist in an NI policy? Why or why not?
	Yes. Since a BLP system can have covert channels and every BLP system complies with NI.

If the NI policy is A− > B, in a BLP system what combinations of the
levels “high” and “low” could A and B have?
	A: Low
	B: High

Lecture 18

1. Why do NI policies better resemble metapolicies than policies?
	A metapolicy is the overall goal of a system. For example in a BLP, y flow 

2. What would be L’s view of the following actions: h1, l1, h2, h3, . . . , hj,
l2, l3, . . . , lk
	The same as if h had done nothing. So: l1,l2,l3,...,lk

3. What is difficult about proving NI for realistic systems?
	Most systems are not entirely deterministic and it requires identifying within the view function all potential channels of information.

Lecture 19

1. Explain the importance of integrity in various contexts.
	I deposit 100 dollars in my account but the system adds an extra 5 0's and suddenly im rich
	A geographical location system displays incorrect coordinates
	I change the algorithm for the next lottery system.

2. Why would a company or individual opt to purchase commercial software
rather than download a similar, freely available version?
	Because most often than not, freely available software do not enforce integrity principles in a strict manner.

3. Explain the difference between separation of duty and separation of function.
	Separation of duty means that multiple people must be involved to perform a critical function. Separation of function means that a person cannot perform more than 1 function in a critical process

4. What is the importance of auditing in integrity contexts?
	Through auditing one can detect when something bad has happened and possibly find ways of fixing the problem. 

5. What are the underlying ideas that raise the integrity concerns of Lipner?
	Users don't write their own programs; programmers do. This programmers do no use the same data that users will do.

6. Name a common scenario where integrity would be more important than
confidentiality.
	A banking system. If someone else can read my statements they will only know how much money, which isnt so bad. If they are able to modify it, then I'm in trouble

Lecture 20

1. Give examples of information that is highly reliable with little sensitivity
and information that is not so highly reliable but with greater sensitivity.
	Information that is highly reliable with little sensitivy: The time. Everyone can access(low sensitivity) and is one of the most reliable things in the planet
	Information that is not so highly reliable but with greater sensitivity: The predictions of when Russia will bomb the US. Very few people can access (sensitive) it but it is just a prediction (unreliable)

2. Explain the dominates relationships for each row in the table on slide 4.
	Expert dominates Student and Physics also dominates Physics. Therefore Label 1 dominates Label 2
	Novice does not dominate Expert, therefore Label 1 does not dominate Label 2
	Student dominates novice and Art dominates empty/null. Therefore Label 1 dominates Label 2

3. Construct the NI policy for the integrity metapolicy.
	A = Expert
	B = Novice
	A -> B
	
4. What does itmean that confidentiality and integrity are “orthogonal issues?”
	That they are separate concepts. A subject's sensitivy(Confidentiality) does not have to be related to his level of trustworthiness(Integrity)


Lecture 21

1. Why is Biba Integrity called the “dual” of the BLP model?
	Because they are exactly opposite. If a blp system A dominates B, then A can read from B. In a biba system, B would be able to read from A

2. Why in the ACM on slide 5 is the entry for Subj3 - Obj3 empty?
	Because neither of them dominates the other

3. If a subject satisfies confidentiality requirements but fails integrity requirements
of an object, can the subject access the object?
	No

Lecture 22

1. What is the assumption about subjects in Biba’s low water mark policy?
	That if they read a lower integrity source, they will be corrupted. Subjects are not able to differentiate between good and bad sources.

2. Are the subjects considered trustworthy?
	No. 

3. Does the Ring policy make some assumption about the subject that the
LWM policy does not?
	Yes, that they have common sense and if they read a bad source, they can be aware of it.
	
4. Are the subjects considered trustworthy?
	Yes because they have the capacity to differentiate between good and bad data.


Lecture 23

1. Are the SD and ID categories in Lipner’s model related to each other?
	Even though integrity and confidential categories are ortogonal, in many cases users posses both of them. For example Application developers

2. Why is it necessary for system controllers to have to ability to downgrade?
	Moving objects from the development to production world means changing their types. There’s no way to do that in BLP or Biba.

3. Can system controllers modify development code/test data?
	No

4. What form of tranquility underlies the downgrade ability?
	Weak Tranquility


Lecture 24

1. What is the purpose of the four fundamental concerns of Clark andWilson?
	To better apply the security principles of Integrity to a commercial context. The overriding concern is consistency among the various components of the system state

2. What are some possible examples of CDIs in a commercial setting?
	Bank statements, User database, Source code
3. What are some possible examples of UDIs in a commercial setting?
	The candy at the front desk, the number of pencils at the reception desk

4. What is the difference between certification and enforcement rules?
	enforcement rules are related to the users of the system. Certification rules are meant so that if the enforcement rules are followed, the system will continue to be consistent through out. 

5. Give an example of a permission in a commercial setting.
	Managers are allowed to hire teller employees

Lecture 25

1. Why would a consultant hired by American Airlines potentially have a
breach of confidentiality if also hired by United Airlines?
	Because he would be able to tell United Airlines flaws in the United Airlines business plan. Both companies are competing against each other.

2. In the example conflict classes, if you accessed a file from GM, then subsequently
accessed a file from Microsoft, will you then be able to access
another file from GM?
	Yes because they are not in the same conflict classes

3. Following the previous question, what companies’ files are available for
access according to the simple security rule?
	Microsoft, GM, Citicorp, Credit Lyonnais and Deutsche Bank
	
4. What differences separate the Chinese Wall policy from the BLP model?
	Permissions change dynamically depending on a subject's object access history
	It is designed to address a very specific security concern

Lecture 26

1. What benefits are there in associating permissions with roles, rather than
subjects?
	It is more applicable to commercial environments 

2. What is the difference between authorized roles and active roles?
	Active roles is a subset of authorized roles

3. What is the difference between role authorization and transaction authorization?
	Role authorization means that a subject's active role can only be from his set of authorized roles. Transaction authorization means that a subject can perform a certain transaction if its allowed by one his actives roles.

4. What disadvantages do standard access control policies have when compared
to RBAC?
	Standard access control policies have a very limited amount of actions (read and write). With RBAC you can assign a much wider set of actions.
	RBAC allows subjects to have multiple roles
	All in all standard access control policies are much less flexible

Lecture 27

1. Why would one not want to build an explicit ACM for an access control
system?
	Because it would take up a lot of space. Much of this space will be empty. The access can rights can usually be computed on the fly

2. Name, in order, the ACM alternatives for storing permissions with objects,
storing permissions with subjects and computing permissions on the fly.
	Maintain a set of rules to compute access permissions based on attributes of subjects and objects
	Associate the permissions with objects. This is called an access control list (ACL).
	Associate the permissions with subjects. This is called a capability-based system
	
Lecture 28
1. What must be true for the receiver to interpret the answer to a “yes” or “no”
question?
	Whether 1 is yes or no. He must also know the question which the message is answering

2. Why would one want to quantify the information content of a message?
	To see if the chosen channel has enough bandwidth for transmitting said message

3. Why must the sender and receiver have some shared knowledge and an
agreed encoding scheme?
	Because otherwise they wouldn't be able to interpret each others message. 

4. Why wouldn’t the sender want to transmit more data than the receiver needs
to resolve uncertainty?
	Higher chance of the message being intercepted; the delivery would take more time.

5. If the receiver knows the answer to a question will be “yes,” how many bits
of data quantify the information content? Explain.
	0 bits. The receiver does not need an answer if he already has it. Otherwise, it would be 1 bit since 0 could be yes and 1 could no



Lecture 29
1. How much information is contained in each of the first three messages from
slide 2?
	N bits, 4 bits, 7 bits

2. Why does the amount of information contained in “The attack is at dawn”
depend on the receiver’s level of uncertainty?
	Because for example if the receivers uncertainty was whether the attack was at dawn or dusk, then the message would be equal to 1 bit. But if it was whether the attack was in the morning, dusk or dawn, then value would be 2 bits.

3. How many bits of information must be transmitted for a sender to send one
of exactly 16 messages? Why?
	4 bits. Because with 4 bits you can represent 16 different messages.

4. How much information content is contained in a message from a space of
256 messages?
	8 bits.
	
5. Explain why very few circumstances are ideal, in terms of sending information
content.
	Because in most cases the receiver and sender haven't agreed on a form of encoding.
	Also, some messages are very complex.
	


Lecture 30
1. Explain the difference between the two connotations of the term “bit.”
	Bit can have a discrete meaning: 0 or 1 for example. But bit can also have a continuous meaning (5.3 bits) which is more appropriate for communication theory.

2. Construct the naive encoding for 8 possible messages.
	000 = Pizza
	001 = Watermelon
	010 = Papaya
	011 = Pineapple
	100 = Chocolate
	101 = Mint
	110 = Strawberry
	111 = Butterflies
	
3. Explain why the encoding on slide 5 takes 995 + (5 * 5) bits.
	Because 995 of the messages only required 1 bit of information. To represent every other message you need 5 bits because the first bit must always equal 1 and you need the other 4 to represent the 15 possible combinations. 

4. How can knowing the prior probabilities of messages lead to a more efficient
encoding? 
	Because messages that are more likely to be sent, can be represent using less bits of information


5. Construct an encoding for 4 possible messages that is worse than the naive
encoding.
	100 = A
	101 = B
	110 = C
	111 = D

6. What are some implications if it is possible to find an optimal encoding?
	That we have found the best encoding there can be for that language.

	
Lecture 31

1. Name a string in the language consisting of positive, even numbers.
	2468 = "Hello"
	2486 = "Bye"

2. Construct a non-prefix-free encoding for the possible rolls of a 6-sided die.
	1 = 0
	2 = 1000
	3 = 1001
	4 = 1010
	5 = 1011
	6 = 1100


3. Why is it necessary for an encoding to be uniquely decodable?
	Because it would be impossible to communicate with someone if one symbol represents multiple things. For example if "Yes" could also mean no then we couldn't get anything done

4. Why is a lossless encoding scheme desirable?
	Because if not the point of the message might be lost or misinterpreted
	For example: "Come to my house at ???am"

5. Why doesn’t Morse code satisfy our criteria for encodings?
	Because it is not streamable. for example "..." could be "S" or "EEE" 

Lecture 32

1. Calculate the entropy of an 8-sided, fair die (all outcomes are equally likely).
	3

2. If an unbalanced coin is 4 times more likely to yield a tail than a head, what
is the entropy of the language?
	Heads = 0.2
	Tails = 0.8
	Enthropy = -(0.2*log0.2 + 0.8*log0.8) = 0.721928

3. Why is knowing the entropy of a language important?
	Because with it you can figure out how well your encoding system is. For example if your average number of bits per message = 5 and the enthropy = 5, then you know you are using the best encoding system for that language

Lecture 33

1. Explain the reasoning behind the expectations presented in slide 3.
	Probabilities of coin landing heads or tail is independent on the previous toss. Therefore to calculate HH for example, we just multiply 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. This means that, on average, if we throw the coin 32 times, we should expect to see 9 heads heads. 

2. Explain why the total expected number of bits is 27 in the example presented
in slide 4.
	On average, out of 32 flips, 9 will be HH which takes 9 bits; 3 will be HT which takes 6 bits; 3 will be TH which takes 9 bits; and 1 will be TT which takes 3 bits. Adding them all up you get 27.

3. What is the naive encoding for the language in slide 5?
	1 = 000
	2 = 001 
	3 = 010
	4 = 011
	5 = 100
	6 = 101

4. What is the entropy of this language?
	2x + 2y + 2z = 1
	x = 2y
	x = 3z
	-------
	2x + x + 2x/3 = 1 -> x = 3/11; y = 3/22; z = 3/33

	1 = 3/11 = 3/11
	2 = 3/11 = 3/11
	3 = 3/22 = 1.5/11
	4 = 3/22 = 1.5/11
	5 = 3/33 = 1/11
	6 = 3/33 = 1/11

	Entropy = 3/11*log2(3/11) + 3/11*log2(3/11) + 3/22*log2(3/22) + 3/22*log2(3/22) + 3/33*log2(3/33) + 3/33*log2(3/33) = 2.43537139077


5. Find an encoding more efficient than the naive encoding for this language.
	1 = 00
	2 = 01
	3 = 100
	4 = 101
	5 = 110
	6 = 111

6. Why is your encoding more efficient than the naive encoding?
	If I send 11 messages, on average I would get the following bits sent:
		3*2 + 3*2 + 1.5*3 + 1.5*3 + 1*3 + 1*3 = 27.
		So on average the amount of bits transmitted is 2.45
	Using the naive encoding I would get the following result:
		3*3 + 3*3 + 1.5*3 + 1.5*3 + 1*3 + 1*3 = 33
		So on average the amount of bits transmitted is 33/11 = 3
