Lecture 17
1)
  No it does not because it could have convert channels in it's design.

2)
  Both A and B would only be allowed to interfere with themselves.

3)
  No they cannot because the policy is meant to prevent to covert channels
  by applying a design that only allows information to flow in a strict and
  defined way.

4)
  A would have low and b would have high so that B could dominate A and therefore
  be able to interfere with B.

Lecture 18
1)
  They better resemble metapolicies because they are more general than 
  policies are much like metapolicies.

2)
  l1,l2,l3,lk

3)
  You generally need to be able to have a model of a system at a very low
  level which is difficult to come by because it is time comsuming to make.

Lecture 19
1)
  Integrity is important because you want your source of data to not
  randomly change. You don't want a malicous program to change information
  on your computer and if something happens to go wrong on your computer
  you don't want this mistake to accidentally change your data.

2)
  They would opt to purchase a commercial version because they trust that
  the company selling it wants to stay profitable so they must put more 
  effort into it than a service which is free.

3)
  Separation of duty means that you may have several subjects involved in 
  critical functions so that if one is potentially corrupted another can 
  catch it. Separation of function means that one subject cannot do both 
  sides of one job such as being a teller and auditor.

4)
  The importance of auditing for integrity is that it is the way to see if
  any unexpected or undocumented changes have occured in data when it
  should not have.

5)
  The underlying idea for Lipner are that he doesn't want people who are designing something working with real data and therefore mess it up on 
  purpose or accident so you seperate the development and the commercial
  use.

6)
  Integrity is far more important than confidentiality in a bank setting.

Lecture 20
1)
  The age of a person is information with high integrity and low 
  confidentiality. Insider information on an even could have greater
  sensitivity but often very low integrity.

2)
  row1:An Expert in Physics is more trustworthy than a student in physics
  row2:A Novice in physics and art is not more trustworthy than an Expert
    in physics
  row3: A student in are is more trustworthy than a novice in nothing.

3)
  An NI policy for integrity could be that reliable sources are allowed to
  interfere with less reliable sources but not vice versa.

4)
  Confidentiality and Integrity being orthoganal means that they do not 
  directly affect one another and should be considered seperately.

Lecture 21
1)
  It is called the duel of BLP because it has the same designs of BLP just flipped for a different desired result.

2)
  It is empty because the subject's set of information is not a super set
  of the object's set of information so it therefore cannot write or read
  even though their access level is equal.

3) 
  No a subject cannot access an object unless it fullfills both a security
  and integrity requirement.

Lecture 22
1)
  The assumption is that if a subject of a certain Integrity level decides
  to read lower level information the it isn't as trustworthy as before.

2)
  Subjects are considered as trustworthy as the information they read.

3)
  The Ring policy makes the assumption that a subject which reads from a
  lower level it should be smart enough to filter out bad information.

4)
  They are considered trustworthy to filter out bad information from
  lower levels.

Lecture 23
1)
  No they are not related because confidentiality and integrity are
  orthoganal to each other.

2)
  It is necessary so that software can move from the development stage
  to a commercial use stage.

3)
   No because it only passes an integrity check and not a Security check.

4)
  Weak tranquility underlies the downgrade ability of the system.

Lecture 24
1)
  The purpose of the four concerns are to ensure that people are 
  held accountable for transactions that they are authorized for.

2)
   The cost of services, the salaries of workers and private information
   are some examples of CDI's 

3)
  When a corparate picnic is going to be, what time an office will be
  open, are some examples of UDI's

4)
   Certification is the idea's with which CDI's and UDI's can be worked
   with while enforments are the rules on what users have access to those.

5)
  {teller,withdral,{bank account,cash}}

Lecture 25
1)
  It could be a breach of confidentiality because they could carry
  information which is proprietary to AA and give it to UA which would
  then give UA an upperhand since they both compete in the same type of
  business.

2)
  Yes I would be able to access it because they both do not belong to the 
  same conflict class.

3)
  Any on company from the bank class which would be a permanet choice.

4)
  The Chinease wall policy is different because it is meant for one
  specific issue in security not for a general security idea.

Lecture 26
1)
  A benifit from a role rather than an associated permission is that
  it makes the system a lot easier when large groups or organizations
  are involved.

2)
  Authorized roles are roles which a person is allowed to do and active
  roles are roles which a person is currently partaking in.

3)
  Role Authorization produces the set of transactions a person is allowed
  to do. Transaction authorization looks to see if a person is active in
  the role required.

4)
  It is far more flexible and easier to implement in large companies, it
  is able to be more appropriate for commercial systems. It alaso allows a
  person to have multiple roles and add roles which is desired in a
  commercial context.

Lecture 27
1)
  In a realistic system most subject don't have access to any objects.

2)
  Objects:Access control list
  Subjects:capabilities
  Computing: Set of rules, look in ACL, or ask subject to provide its' verification

Lecture 28
1)
  It must be true that the sender and the reciever have agreed upon an
  encoding scheme.

2)
  You could want to quantify the information content in order to keep
  track of the amount of information being send between the two.

3)
  This is so that they will be able to effectively communicate without
  the possibility of misunderstanding or turning noise into a message.

4)
  The sender want to be as efficient as possible so that thre is no 
  potentai lfor confusion or misinterpretation.

5)
  1 bit of data quantify the information content because either a 1 or 0
  could be deemed a "yes" or "no" depending on the agreeded upon encoding.

Lecture 29
1)
  m1:n bits of information
  m2:4 bits of information 
  m3:7 bits of information

2)
  It depends on the level of uncertainty because the less the reciever 
  already knows the more the sender has to tell it.

3)
  4 bits of information because with each bit the number of possibilities
  that the message could be is halved. That is only true if it has been
  agreeded between both that there are only exactly 16 possibilities.

4)
  log base 2 of 256, bits of information

5)
  Very few are ideal because it is not very often that the exact number
  of possible answers or responses is known for any given question.

Lecture 30
1)
  The difference is that in one sense bit is conveying a discrete digit
  the other sense is conveyinga quantity of total information.

2)
  000
  001
  010
  100
  011
  110
  101
  111

3)
  This is because 99.5% of the messages  would just be a single bit. The 
  other .5% take 5 bits to convey the message.

4)
  It can lead to more efficient encoding because a paricular encoding set up to take advantage of the probabilities could be used to lower the
  average message size.

5)
  m1:0
  m2:101
  m3:110
  m4:111

6)
  An implication of finding an optimal encoding is being able to send
  more messages per second of time.

Lecture 31
1)
  2468

2)
  0:0
  1:1
  2:010
  3:110
  4:001
  5:101
  6:011

3)
  It is necessary so that there is no ambiguity in the decoding of
  a message that is sent.

4)
  Lossless encoding is desireable because all the information that
  someone wants to send can get sent without getting trimmed down to a 
  message that gets the same point across.

5)
  Morse code doesn't satify the criteria for encoding because it cannot
  be streamed since it requires breaks.

Lecture 32
1)
  -log(1/8)

2)
  -([4/5*log(4/5)] + [1/5*log(1/5)])

3)
  It is important because it can help you figure out how effiecient an
  encoding is compared to the optimal encoding to see if there is another
  possible way to get a better encoding.

Lecture 33
1)
  The expectations are produced from the probabilities of either heads
  or tails.

2)
  The total number of bits is 27 because of the use of an encoding that
  has a variable number of bits per 2flips which saves the number of bits
  used when applying the shorter encodings on the most likey flips.

3)
  1:100
  2:010
  3:110
  4:001
  5:101
  6:111

4)
  prob 1 or 2:6/20 = A
  prob 3 or 4:3/20 = B
  prob 5 or 6:1/20 = C
  entropy = -(2Alog(A) + 2Blog(B) + 2Clog(C))
  entropy = .69

5)
  1:00
  2:01
  3:10
  4:110
  5:111
  6:101

6)
  This encoding is more effiecient than the naive encoding because it 
  takes advantage of the probabilities of each outcome and minimizes the 
  number of bits to send the more likey outcomes.
