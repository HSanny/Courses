A is unable to interfere or communicate with B.3. No because the basis of the NI policy is to never allow communication between SH and SL, thus, eliminating covert channels.4. B would be high and A would be low, which allows information to flow up from A to B.Lecture 181. The NI policy is abstract and there are no rules about which subjects can read/write which objects. There is nothing about objects or actions at all.2.  l1 , l2, l3, …, lk3. Interferences are very common in real systems. Most involve low-level system attributes and many interferences are benign.Lecture 191. Integrity is important when it comes to many things. For example, you would want your bank account information not to be erroneously change, as well as shipping addresses in shopping websites. Integrity relates to how much we trust an entity to produce, protect, or modify data.2. Integrity of a subject is the confidence that one places in its ability to produce. That is why companies and individuals choose commercial software. The trust these companies to produce more reliable software.3. Separation of duty means that serveral different subjects must be involved to complete a critical function. Separation of Function is a single subject cannot complete complementary roles within a critical process. 4. Auditing keeps careful records in case something bad happens and you can go back and take care of the problem. 5. Users will not write their own programs, but use existing production software. Programmers develop and test applications on a non-production system, possibly using contrived data. Moving applications from development to productions requires a special process. This process must be controlled and audited. Managers and auditors must have access to system state and system logs. 6. Bank settings because they can incur many losses through lack of integrity.Lecture 201. Information on UT direct is highly reliable but with little sensitivity but Google search may not be as reliable because of a lot of untrusted website, but those untrusted websites may hold a lot of sensitive information. 2. On the first row, label 1 dominates level to because label 1 is an expert, which is higher than a student, and they share the same categories. On the second row, label 1 does not dominate label because novice is lower than expert. On the third row, label 1 dominates label 2 because student is higher than a novice and label 1 is a superset of label 2. 3. Low integrity information should not flow up into high integrity information.4. Integrity and confidentiality are not related to one another and should be treated separately. Lecture 211. We just changed the directions of the arrow for the simple security property and * property. 2. Subj3 is the same level as Obj3 but the categories are not a superset and that means it cant write nor read the object.  3. No because in order to gain access, it must pass both rules.Lecture 221. The subject may be corrupted by information of lower integrity and so his rule is to lower the integrity of that subject down to that level. 2. Biba does not give much credit to the subject.3. The assumption is that the subject has common sense to filter out bad information.4. It is more trustworthy and it allows it to read objects without changing its integrity level. Lecture 231. They are both in the development stage.2. By being able to downgrade, it gives them the ability to move software from the development to production. 3. Yes. ??4. Weak tranquility.Lecture 241. Authentication identifies all users that take action against the system. Audit keeps track of what users do and it cannot be subverted. Well-formed transactions constrain users form manipulating data. Separation of duty requires different people to operate in order to complete one activity.2. Bank balances, checks, etc.3. Complementary items, blank deposit or withdrawal checks, etc.4. Certification is a way of looking at the state of the system and deciding whether things are consistent. Enforcements are rules that regulate the process in which things are done.   5. A teller is authorized to deposit your money/checks into your balance/account.Lecture 251. There maybe a potential conflict of interest because he may carry some information over that might disadvantage American Airlines. 2. Yes because Microsoft is not from the same conflict class.3. Files in the same company datasets as the objects already accessed, or files belonging to an entirely different conflict of interest class.4. The Chinese Wall Policy is designed to address conflicts of interest by a consultant or contractor.Lecture 261. It makes managing a big organization much more possible. It makes it easier to just assign it to a role than each individual person.2. Authorized roles are roles that the person can take on through the course of some time. Active roles are roles in which they currently occupy.3. Role authorization states that a subject’s active role must be an authorized role for that subject while a transaction authorization can execute a transaction only if the transaction is authorized for one of the subject’s active roles. 4. RBACs are easier to administer, permissions are appropriate, it recognizes that a subject often has various functions within the organization, and it allows a subject to transition between roles without having to change identities. Lecture 271. Because in realistic systems, most subjects don’t have access to most objects. 2. Access control list (ACL), Capability-based systems, and access implicitly as a series of rules “on the fly”.Lecture 281. The receiver must know to interpret the sender’s message. Receiver must know which bit  is yes and which bit is no.2. To know how much information can be pushed across the channel in a given amount of time (bits per second).3. Without shared knowledge or encoding scheme, no communication is going to occur. 4. .5. You want to transmit as efficiently as possible in order to manage bandwidth.6. One bit of data.Lecture 291. N bits of information, 4 bits, 7 bits.2. Presumably there is less information in the message and that depends on the level of uncertainty. 3. 4 bits because the we can code each of those 16 messages explicitly as a 4 bit string.4. 8 bits.5. In most scenarios, you do not have the situation in which a transmitted bit can reduce the uncertainty by half. Lecture 301. One bit is a binary digit (discrete) or bit can be a quantity of information (continuous). 2. M0 – 000, M1 - 001, M2 – 010, M3 – 011, M4 – 100, M5 – 101, M6 – 110, M7 – 1113. We use 995 bits for 10 + the remaining 5 messages, which are 5 bits each (5 * 5).4. Knowing the probabilities can make the encoding more efficient and prevent you from making it less efficient. 5. M0 – 100, M1 – 101, M2 – 110, M3 – 0. Let’s say we have 100 messages and only one of them is message for. That makes 99 messages be error messages which will result in 1 + (99 * 3) which is worse than 100 * 2 (naïve). 6. Depends on the prior probabilities. Lecture 311. 24682. 1 – 0, 2 – 01, 3 – 011, 4 – 0111, 5 – 01111, 6 – 011111 3. The receiver gets to recover unambiguously what the sender was intending to send. 4. You want the receiver to completely recover the sequence of symbols without any loss of information.5. Morse code has breaks between each letter and it is not streaming. Lecture 321. h  = -(log 1/8) = log82. h = -( 1/5 loh 1/5 + 4/5 log 4/5)3. Entropy sets a lower limit on endogen efficiency. Lecture 331. Each flip is independent of the other flips. For example getting heads is ?. Getting HH then is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16.2. You multiple the count or amount of times it happens with the amount of bits it takes to represent them and add them all up. 3. 1 – 000, 2 – 001, 3 – 010, 4 – 011, 5 – 100, 6 – 101.4. h = -(6/20 log 6/20 + 6/20 log 6/20 + 3/20 log 3/20 + 3/20 log 3/20 + 1/20 log 1/20 + 1/20 log 1/20)5. By pairing up 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6 you can increase the efficiency just like the 16 – 2flip example.6. Encoding is better than 1 bit per symbol.
