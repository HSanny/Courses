Week 2 Questions

Lecture 17
1. In the BLP model, the dominates relationship would be equivalent to the SL -> SH relationship.
2. Neither could interfere with the other.
3. No, because they imply that information can exclusively travel in one direction.
4. Either both are low, both are high, or A is low and B is high.

Lecture 18
1. Because they only specify the relationship that we hope to achieve rather than the implementation that makes such a relationship happen.
2. l1, l2, l3, ..., lk
3. Inteferences are very common in real systems, most involve low-level system attributes, and many interferences are benign.

Lecture 19
1. For news sources integrity means maintaining the reliability of information. For computer systems integrity might mean maintaining the functionality of components and the validity/accuracy of information.
2. Because the commercial credentials or name attached to the product might imply a higher quality, more reliable product.
3. Separation of duty means that several different subjects must be involved to complete a critical function, while separation of function means that a single subject cannot complete complementary roles within a critical process.
4. It makes sure there is accountability and recoverability.
5. Users shouldn't write their own programs, programmers test their products on a nonproduction system, moving applications from production to development takes a special process, the process must be controlled and audited, and managers and auditors must have access to system state and system logs.
6. In certain commerical settings where the constant validity of information is required.

Lecture 20
1. Highly reliable, not sensitive - NYTimes sports report
   Unreliable, highly sensitive - the estimated whereabouts of potential extraterrestrial research facilities on Earth
2. first - Label 1 dominates 2 because Expert is a higher level than student and they have identical expertise labels
   second - Neither label dominates the other because Novice is lower than Expert even though Label 1's expertise labels are a superset of Label 2's expertise labels. 
   third - Label 1 dominates Label 2 because Student is higher level than Novice and the expertise labels {Art} is a superset of no expertise labels.
3. It is the opposite of that of BLP to NI: H -> L instead of L -> H.
4. It means that they are unrelated issues and have to be treated separately.

Lecture 21
1. Because the policies are reverse of each other. Every 'write' in a BLP access control matrix is replaced with a 'read' in a Biba access control matrix, and vice-versa.
2. Neither label dominates the other, so neither can read from or write to the other.
3. No it cannot.

Lecture 22
1. That once they are exposed to low integrity information they are likely to contaminate high integrity information.
2. No.
3. That once they are exposed to low integrity information they are expable of excercising discretion and stopping themselves from contaminating high integrity information.
4. Yes.

Lecture 23
1. I think that programs under development (SD) are likely to be in the integrity category of development as well (ID).
2. So that programs can be moved from development to production.
3. Yes.
4. Weak tranquility. 

Lecture 24
1. To implement a system with high integrity?
2. Account balance, account information.
3. 
4. Certification is how a system certifies/confirms that a data item is in a valid state while enforcement is how a system ensures that a certified data item stays valid.
5. 

Lecture 25
1. Because they are competitors, so information useful to American Airlines would be sensitive and they wouldn't want their competitors (United Airlines) to get that information.
2. Yes, you can go to back to work for anyone you have worked for before, and Microsoft and GM are not in the same conflict class.
3. GM, Microsoft, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citicorp.
4. There is no dominates relationship, labels are separated into classes and you can't access more than one label from any given class. Ultimately, the models simply have different concerns.

Lecture 26
1. You don't have to keep track of permissions for each individual separately, but rather simply based on the roles that they are assigned.
2. Authorized roles are roles that a subject is allowed to take on at different times, while active roles are the roles for whom the subject has permission at a specific point in time.
3. Role authorization means that a subject's active role must be an authorized role for that subject, and transaction authorization means that a subject can execute a transaction only if the transaction is authorized for one of the subject's active roles.
4. RBAC is more flexible, recognizes that a subject often has various functions, and allows subjects to transition between roles without having to change identities.

Lecture 27
1. Because it can use a lot of space/memory, and it might be better to just compute permissions on the fly or store accesses with the subjects/objects.
2. Access control list, capability based system, on the fly.

Lecture 28
1. The sender and receiver must have some shared knowledge, including an agreed encoding scheme.
2. So you can get an idea of the kind of information being encoded.
3. Otherwise they receiver won't know which signal means 'yes' or 'no' and won't know when the message starts or ends, among other things.
4. Because more information than necessary increases what others can work with to figuer out the encoding?
5. Would it need any? They already know the content and have some other way of getting the information... Or just one, I guess.

Lecture 29
1. first - n bits. second - 4 bits. third - 7 bits.
2. Because if the uncertainty is between dusk or dawn, it can be encoded in one bist (like yes or no). But if he has no idea about an attack in the first place, you have to encode the whole message.
3. 4 bits. There are 16 possible messages and four bits have 16 different permutations.
4. 8 bits.
5. Sender and Receiver must know in advance the space of possible transmission and they must have an agreed encoding.

Lecture 30
1. Bit can mean a binary digit (which is discrete) or a quantity of information (which is continuous)
2. M1 - 000 ; M2 - 001 ; M3 - 010 ; M4 - 011 ; M5 - 100 ; M6 - 101 ; M7 - 110 ; M8 - 111
3. 995 of the 1000 message are encode as '0' which is a single bit. The remaining 5 messages are stored as 5 bits each.
4. Though most messages use an extra bit to encode, 95% of the messages transmitted are only a single bit so you cut down on the size of the vast majority of the message.
5. M1 - 1 ; M2 - 11 ; M3 - 111 ; M4 - 1111
6. It means that there is a single way of encoding a set of possible messages that would always minimize the number of bits needed to transmit information.

Lecture 31
1. 2 28 34 78 10 12
2. 1 - 1 ; 2 - 11 ; 3 - 111 ; 4 - 0 ; 5 - 00 ; 6 - 000
3. So that messages are unambiguous.
4. So that the entirety of the information one wants to send somewhere else can be recovered where it ends up.
5. Because not all of the most common letters used have the shortest encodings.

Lecture 32
1. -(1/8 * log(1/8) + 1/8 * log(1/8) + 1/8 * log(1/8) + 1/8 * log(1/8) + 1/8 * log(1/8) + 1/8 * log(1/8) + 1/8 * log(1/8) + 1/8 * log(1/8))
2. -(4/5 * log(4/5) + 1/5 * log(1/5))
3. It sets a lower limit on encoding efficiency.

Lecture 33
1. probability of HH is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16. prob of HT and TH is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16. prob of TT is (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16.
2. Given 32 flips: 9 pairs (16 flips) use 1 bit, 3 pairs (6 flips) use 2 bits, 3 pairs (6 flips) use 3 bits, and 1 pair (2 flips) uses four bits. This adds up to 27 bits for the 32 flips.
3. 1 - 000 ; 2 - 001 ; 3 - 010 : 4 - 011 ; 5 - 100 ; 6 - 101
4. -(1/6 * log(1/6) + 1/6 * log(1/6) +  1/6 * log(1/6) +  1/6 * log(1/6) +  1/6 * log(1/6) +  1/6 * log(1/6))
