Lecture 17
1) Yes, BLP has to follow non-interference since information can only flow in one direction, and that is towards a higher security level.

2) A and B would not be connected in any way.

3) No, non-interference policies dictates which subjects are allowed to communicate or interfere with any other subject with out clerence in a way that information can be sent.

4) A would be low and B would be high


Lecture 18
1) Non-interference policies declare the goal trying to be accomplished, not the method to do so.

2) . ., l1, . . . ,l2, l3, . . . , lk

3) You have to consider all possible interferences in a system.  They may even be encrypted.


Lecture 19
1) Integrity determines the truthworthiness of a piece of information.

2) The commercial software may be from a well trusted source known well around the world.  Whereas the free ware may come from an unknown distrubuter (and come packed with a bunch of unwanted third-party software)

3) Separation of Duty is multiple subjects participating together to complete a function.  Separation of Function is when subjects are participating in different roles to complete a process.

4) Auditing is for keeping track of processes and determining what went wrong and possibly undoing the mistake.

5) When developing and producing applications, the process must be controlled and audited to maintain the integrity of their software and company name.

6) The stock exchange, everyone can read the stock prices but if someone could alter their stock information to thier benefit they could cheat the system for a lot of money.


Lecture 20
1) A case for information that is reliable but not sensitve would probably be the local news/ weather reports, and information with low reliablility and high sensitivity would be whatever report the US had that said Iraq had WMDs.

2) The chart on page 4 determines who has more credability and reliability than what in a certain area of expertise

4) They are separate issues that are independent of each other.


Lecture 21
1) Biba is the counter form of BLP, subjects can only read up or write down in order to maintain integrity.

2) Biba Integrity is not the complete reverse of BLP, if neither the Subject nor the Object are dominatnt, than the object cannot be read or written to.

3) The subject can read the object but not write to it.


Lecture 22
1) In Low Water Mark, subjects are assumed to be trusted enough to read objects of low clearence, or possibly foul information.

2) Yes

3) Ring Policy says subjects are trusted enough to read anything no matter how low the clearance of the object.

4) Yes, all subjects are trusted.


Lecture 23
1) Not exactly, while they are both focused on development.  SD is about the Confidentiality of the development while ID is about Integrity.

2) System conrollers need to downgrade an object when they move it from development into production

3) Yes, system controllers have access to System Production and System Development in low level confidentiality and high level integrity

4) Downgrading allows for moving the software from development level to production level so that applications can begin being sent out for commercial use.


Lecture 24
1) Authentication: Users must be who they say they are
   Audit: All modifications need to be recorded
   Well-formed transactions: users may only change data in the way they are permitted to
   Separation of duty: They system allows certain users to use certain programs to prevent unauthorized modification
   These four concerns allow for users to have access to the programs they need while maintaining integrity of data.

2) A bank would be an example of a CDI as keeping the integrity of their accounts is key to their business.

3) In the fast food industry, a restaruant may not try to remember what you ate there today and try to protect that information.  It's just not that important.

4) Certification is the set of rules that TPs/IVPs must follow while executing.  Enforcement is the rules for the user while executing the procedures.

5) When making a withdrawl from an ATM, a user will only have permission to make a transaction on whatever accounts that they have access to.


Lecture 25
1) That consultant will have information about American Airlines that could place them at an unfair advantage now that said information would be in the possession of United Airlines.

2) Yes, because GM and Microsoft are not in the same conflict class, they have no information that they could use to disadvantage the other.

3) GM, Microsoft, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citicorp

4) Accessing information from one group will deny access to all other groups in the same conflict class, accessing information in from any other group in any other class is still free to do.  BLP just says you can't read/write with out the proper clearance.


Lecture 26
1) Instead of assigning permission to each individual, you assign permissions to each role/job, then assign a subject to a role.

2) Authorized roles are roles a subject can take on. An active roles is the job that the subject is currently working on.

3) Role authorization is checking to see if a subject is allowed to take on a given role.  Transaction authorization is checking to see if a subject's active role is allowed to perform a given transaction.

4) Separation of Duty, a subject with a certain active role may be denied another (and all the permissions with it) for having the first active role.


Lecture 27
1) In most systems many users will not have access to the objects around them, so the ACM will just be a big matrix of blank spaces, which is not very efficient.

2) a) Access Control List
   b) capability-based system
   c) "on the fly"


Lecture 28
1) The reciever and the sender need to agree on what yes or no means so the sender can ask that question.

2) To perseve bandwidth

3) To properly communicate with each other and again, perserve bandwidth.

4) Because that will take up bandwidth.

5) One. The reciever will only need to relpy with one bit that will either represnt yes or no.  The sender will understand that it is only recieving a one bit answer and work with that.


Lecture 29
1) a) n bits
   b) 4 bits
   c) 7 bits

2) There needs to be an agreed upon form of communication that will cover how ever many number of messages that they plan to send or might send.  With each bit sent, the reciever's uncertainty is cut down by half.

3) 4 bits, a four bit binary number can be used to represent 16 total messages.

4) 8 bits

5) You can only send a limited number of messages with this method. Whereas in ASCII you could send an infinite amount of messages at the cost of quantity effiecency.


Lecture 30
1) A bit may either mean a binary digit or a quantity of information.

2)

000 - M0
001 - M1
010 - M2
011 - M3
100 - M4
101 - M5
110 - M6
111 - M7

3) Becuase 995 messages will be a single bit long, the other 5 will be 5 bits long.

4) You can set up the encoding so that more common messages can be represented by fewer bits.

5) 1    - M1
   01   - M2
   001  - M3
   0001 - M4

6) If your compression size comes far from the calculated lower limit.


Lecture 31
1) 651 231 51 8

2) 0   - 1
   1   - 2
   00  - 3
   01  - 4
   000 - 5
   001 - 6

3) So that all encoded information can represent one straightforward message and not be interprited as anything else.

4) So that the encoded message can be recovered after transmitting.

5) Morse code is not uniquely decodable


Lecture 32

1) -1*log2(1/8) = 3

2) -1 * (1/5*log2(1/5) + 4/5*log2(4/5)) = 0.7219

3) Entropy measures the average information content, or how small a message may be encoded in this case.


Lecture 33
1) Since the Heads is likely to show up 3/4 of the time we multiply it's probability with itself to get the probability that there will be another head after the first one.  So it is most likely to show up and will get the smallest code to represent it.

2) Since we are representing single messages for two flips and we used less bits to represent common occurances and more bits to represent fewer occurances we can send 27 bits to represent 32 flips (in this expected case).

3)

000 - 1
001 - 2
010 - 3
011 - 4
100 - 5
101 - 6

4) -1 * (6/20*log2(6/20) + 6/20*log2(6/20) + 3/20*log2(3/20) + 3/20*log2(3/20) + 1/20*log2(1/20) + 1/20*log2(1/20)) = 2.2955

5)

10    - 1
11    - 2
010   - 3
011   - 4
001   - 5
000   - 6

6) It uses two bits for the more common occurances
