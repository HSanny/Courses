Lecture 17
1. Not necessarily true: NI policies can be non-transitive, whereas B&LP requires the transitive
2. No interference between A and B
3. No, covert channels can't exist because non-interference implies that a H-level can't do anything that has an effect visible to L-level
4. A and B could be (respectively): (high, high), (low, low), (low, high)

Lecture 18
1. They resemble metapolicies because the goals of non-interference are very general (like metapolicies); interference is a general term
2. Assuming non-interference: l1, l2, l3, lk
3. NI for realistic systems is difficult because: real systems have a lot of interference, most involve low level system attributes, and many interferences are benign

Lecture 19
1. Integrity is important in computer security because you don't want people/programs to change data to their benefit/your detriment. It is important in the context of scientific articles because research is based off the results of other research; falsified data is bad for the whole community
2. Commercial software is likely to have certifications and credibility, whereas freeware doesn't need to uphold the same level of quality; the commercial software has more integrity
3. Separation of duty states that a critical task cannot be completed by too few people; separation of function means a single person isn't allowed access to several critical functions (which could work together to undermine a security goal)
4. Auditing is important in integrity contexts because if there is a log of all data read/writes (for example), it is possible to tell where integrity is at risk in the system
5. separation of function and auditing is very important in Lipner's concerns
6. Integrity is oftentimes more important than confidentiality in commercial settings

Lecture 20
1. High reliability, low sensitivity: trusted news source. Low reliability, high sensitivity: military secrets sold by anonymous person
2. Expert{physics} dominates Student{physics}, Novice{physics,art} and Expert{physics} do not dominate one another, Student{art} dominates Novice{}
3. Low integrity subjects cannot interfere with the actions of high integrity objects
4. This means both subjects are treated separately, and that confidentiality and integrity labels cannot be interchanged

Lecture 21
1. Biba is the dual to BLP because its read/write is the exact same as BLP, with the inequalities reversed
2. Neither set in Obj3/Subj3 is the subset of the other, no dominates relation, so no read/write operation
3. No.

Lecture 22
1. Subjects are all allowed to read anything, but are not given any credit/trust to read at their own/higher level
2. They are trustworthy until they read things below their level, at which point they might be compromised
3. Ring policy assumes the subject won't be corrupted by bad information
4. The subjects are considered more trustworthy than for LWM

Lecture 23
1. Confidentiality and Integrity are orthogonal, so SD and ID do not interact
2. The ability to downgrade gives system controllers the ability to move software from development to production
3. No, the integrity levels do not dominate one another
4. Weak tranquility

Lecture 24
1. The four fundamental concerns are used so that the security metapolicies are more in line with what is important for commerical security
2. CDI - worker wages, profit margins. 
3. UDI - price of items, store locations
4. certification rules deal with authentification/who can do what. enforcement rules determine how TPs must be done
5. permission: ability to raise wages of employee (by manager)

Lecture 25
1. The consultant might carry some proprietary information to United Airlines because they are competitors
2. Yes, there is no conflict between GM and itself
3. GM, Microsoft, McDonalds, no car or software companies
4. Chinese Wall deals with conflict classes and is more specific about catering to the conflict classes problem

Lecture 26
1. Roles make managing easier, since you don't have to assign permissions to each individual emplyee
2. Authorized roles are all the roles an individual can do, and active roles are the current roles in use
3. Role authorization says your active role must be correct, transaction authorization says your transaction must be correct for your current role
4. It is more flexible: easy to administer,permissions are more specific to firm (rather than read/write), allows subjects to have multiple roles, can change roles without changing identity

Lecture 27
1. Most subjects don't have access to any objects, don't want to give EVERYONE that information
2. Access control list, capability list, compute on the fly with attributes of obj/sub

Lecture 28
1. Receiver has to know what kind of answer it will receive, and how to interpret the message
2. To know how many messages one can send, and how fast you can send that amount of messages
3. They need this for the sender to know what kind of encoded message to send, and for the receiver to know how to interpret it
4. Sender wants to transmit as efficiently as possible
5. 0, there is no information content, since the answer is already known

Lecture 29
1. n bits, 4 bits, 7 bits
2. because there are different ways to encode letters into bits
3. 4 bits, because 4 bits is enough to encode exactly 16 different messages
4. 8 bits
5. Large dependence on receiver's level of uncertainty

Lecture 30
1. binary digit (discrete), or a quantity of information (continuous)
2. 1-000, 2-001, 3-010, 4-011, 5-100, 6-101, 7-110, 8-111
3. 1 bit per message 10 (995 on average), 5 other bits for rest of messages (5 out of 100 on average)
4. Because messages with higher priorities can be given smaller encodings, and therefore less bits used on average
5. 1-100, 2- 010, 3- 111, 4-000
6. You know the probabilities of each symbol of message occurring

Lecture 31
1. 246842
2. 1-000, 2-001, 3-010, 4-011, 5-100, 6-101
3. Because you don't want a sent message to be ambiguously one message or another
4. Because you want to be able to see the whole message sent
5. Morse code uses prefixes

Lecture 32
1. -(log(1/8)) = log8
2. -(1/5log(1/5) + 4/5log(4/5))
3. Tells you average information contexnt of symbols in language, sets lower limit on encoding efficiency

Lecture 33
1. By combining 2 messages into one, its possible to send the more probable messages in less than 2 bits which would be impossible with just sending 1 bit at a time
2. for each result, the expected count * # of bits is summed up to make 27 bits total
3. 1-000, 2-001, 3-010, 4-011, 5-100, 6-101
4. 1-10 2-00 3-110 4-111 5-0111 6-0101
5. This encoding is more efficient because 1 and 2 which occur the most requires the least bits to send, 3 and 4 which occur second most requires the second least, and 5 and 6 occur the least and require the most bits; on the average less bits will be sent than the naive one
