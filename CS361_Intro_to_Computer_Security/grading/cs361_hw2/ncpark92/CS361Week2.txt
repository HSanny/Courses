CS361 Questions: Week 2

Lecture 17

1. The computer system would not necessarily comply with NI because of the covert channels that might exist. The flow of information would however be the same idea.

2. The NI policy would be that A and B are seperate and cannot interfere with each other since neither A nor B dominates another.

3. Covert channels cannot exist in an NI policy because the dominant subject is not allowed to interfere with the lower subjects.

4. A could be low and B could be high; A and B could both be low; A and B could both be high.


Lecture 18

1. NI policy tells you which way information can flow which is similar to what a metapolicy would state but policies are much more detailed in that they tell how to fulfill the metapolicy.

2. L would only see its own level of actions so: l1,l2,l3,....lk

3. Interferences are too common in real systems; they can be benign like file encryptions.


Lecture 19

1. Integrity is focused more on trustworthiness than confidentiality. For example, who is allowed to supply or modify data, how do you protect your assets, how do you detect and/or correct erroneous or unauthorized changes to data, and can those authorizations change over time.

2. The commercial software has a name and reputation attached to it which gives it more trustworthiness than freeware.

3. Separation of Duty is when you have multiple subjects involved in a function. For example, at the bank you would have a teller, auditor,ect. inorder for the bank to function. Separation of Function is that the teller won't do the auditor's job also.

4. Auditing gives you a record of what has occurred so you can trace any changes or access' to your assets.

5. Inegrity is more important than confidentiality converns in commercial  settings. 

6. In banking, integrity would be more important than confidentiality because you do not want someone changing their account balance.


Lecture 20

1. An example of information that is highly reliable but with little sensitivity might be the score to the NBA finals. An example of information not so highly reliable but greater sensitivity might be where Lebron is headed now that the Heat lost.

2. For row 1, expert dominates students and they are both physics.
   For row 2, novice is dominated by expert and physics is part of the superset that includes both physics and art.
   For row 3, student dominates novice and there is no categories for novice.

3. Don't allow information to flow up in integrity.

4. It means that they are not the same thing and have different rules that dictate how information should be treated.


Lecture 21

1. It means that the properties used to determine what subjects can read what objects are reversed. For example, the higher ranked subject can read all lower and equally ranked objects in BLP but in Biba Integrity the lower ranked subject can read all while higher ranked subject cannot read lower ranked objects.

2. The categories {a,b} and {b,c} are not the same and since the subject does not have access to category c they are not allowed neither read nor write access to the object.

3. No, the subject needs access by both rules in order to access the object.


Lecture 22

1. The assumption in the Low Water Mark Policy is that the subject cannot differentiate between good and bad information; the subject cannot be trusted.

2. The subjects are not considered trustworthy as the tendency is for the labels to go towards the bottom.

3. The Ring Policy gives more credit to the subject and assumes that they can tell what is information that they can trust and what is bad information. 

4. The subjects are considered trustworthy.


Lecture 23

1. The SD and ID categories are not related to one another; the one thing they have in common is that they both refer to development but they represent two different things.

2. Moving objects from development to production means changing the labels and there is no way to do that through BLP or Biba.

3. Yes they have the flag SP and SD which are integrity tags that say access to modifying development code.

4. Some modifications relating to tranquility were required to allow downgrading.


Lecture 24

1. The four fundamental concerns of Clark and Wilson are for consistency when making an integrity model for commercial security.

2. Some CDI's in a commercial setting might be your bank account balance or your credit card information on Amazon.

3. Some UDI's might be the number of stickers handed out at the hospital or office supplies.

4. Certification deals with the assests in that there are procedures in place to keep the assets' integrity while enforcement deals more with the subjects whereby the subjects are allowed to do only those things within the scope of there access.

5. (Nathan Park, withdrawal, {checking account})


Lecture 25

1. The consultant could have information on American Airlines which they could then share with United Airlines.

2. Yes, they are in different conflict classes and GM is a company which you have opened a file for previously meaning you are not breaching any confidentiality.

3. You would have access to GM and Microsoft and any other the "bank" conflict class.

4. The permissions change dynamically meaning the subjects access rights depend on the history of past accesses. This is unlike BLP which have set access rights that do not change over time.


Lecture 26

1. Since there are likely many subjects that fulfill the same roles and have the same access rights, it is much more efficient to associate permissions with lets say 6 roles than 100 people.

2. Authorized roles are roles that a subject are allowed to fill while active roles are the roles that the subject currently fills. For example, you may be authorized to be the teller and auditor at a bank but you wouldn't have both as your active role; maybe just teller.

3. Role authorization is where a subject must be allowed to have that active role while transaction authorization takes place after the active role is authorized. The transaction taking place must be authorized for the active role that the subject has.

4. The RBAC is in generally much more flexible than the standard access control policies. They are more fitting to an organization and allow transition between roles without having to change identities.


Lecture 27

1. I believe this was answered before but for any real system the ACM would be incredibly huge.

2. Access Control List, Capability-based System


Lecture 28

1. The receiver and sender must have some shared knowledge, including an agreed encoding.

2. You would want to quantify the information content in order to find out how much information can be transmitted over a covert channel.

3. Information will be sent in bits which is limited in the information it can convey so an encoding scheme is needed.

4. it is very inefficient to send more data than needed. It takes more time and resources

5. 1 bit of information quantifies the information content because it only requires either a 0 or 1.


Lecture 29

1. n-bit binary number would be n bits
   single decimal digit would be 4 bits
   two digit decimal number would be 7 bits

2. Depending on the level of uncertainty you may require only one bit or several. For example, if the only uncertainty were whether at dawn or dusk then 1 bit.

3. Four bits of information must be sent in order for one of 16 messages to be sent. This is because each of the 16 numbers 0-15 represented in binary can be used to represent a message using an excoding scheme.

4. There are 8 bits of information in 256 messages because you can plug 256 messages into the formula log2(x) to get 8.

5. What that probably means, is that messages that are being sent are rarely as simple as sending a few bits and most likely require a much larger amount of bits.


Lecture 30

1. One of the connotations of bit stands for the actual bit, the 1 or 0, that is sent. The other is more synonymous with amount of information.

2. M1 000
   M2 001
   M3 010
   M4 011
   M5 100
   M6 101
   M7 110
   M8 111

3. Since 95% of the messages will be message 10, we can assume that 995 of 1000 messages will be message 10. This leaves us with 5 messages that are not message 10 and those 5 require 5 bits to transmit. Message 10 only requires 1  bit so there are 995 of them.

4. We can make the encoding more efficient in terms of bits used to send information  like in question 3 where message 10 was only 1 bit.

5. M1 0000
   M2 0001
   M3 0011
   M4 0111

6. If there is an optimal encoding, that means that there are many suboptimal encodings. There is also probably a formula in order to find out the best encoding.


Lecture 31

1. "2468101214"

2. 1 0
   2 01
   3 011
   4 0111
   5 01111
   6 011111

3. The receiver of the message must be able to tell what the code is saying otherwise like in the example provided on slide 5, there may be too much ambiguity and the message may be lost.

4. You want the message to be received exactly as you sent it.

5. Morse code is not necessarily uniquely decodeable; some letters have the same prefix as other letters.


Lecture 32

1. h = -(log1/8) = log8 = 3

2. h = -((4/5)log2(4/5) + (1/5)log2(1/5)) = .7219

3. The entropy is important because it is equal to the number of bits required in order to send the message most efficiently.


Lecture 33

1. Since heads is 3/4 as likely, you can just multiply it through 3/4 * 3/4 to get 9/16 for probability.

2. Using the probability, we would expect HH to happen 9/16, HT 3/16, TH 3/16. and TT 1/16. The encoding requires 9 6 9 and 3 respectively which equals 27.

3. 1 0
   2 10
   3 110
   4 1110
   5 11110
   6 111110

4. h = -( (4/7)log2(4/7) + (2/7)log2(2/7) + (1/7)log2(1/7) ) = 1.37

5. 1 0
   2 01
   3 10
   4 110
   5 1110
   6 11110

6. It is more efficient because it uses less bits from 3-6. I was able to make this adjustment on the assumption that since 1 and 2 are equally likely I could make 0 an indicator for whether or not it was a 1 or 2.
