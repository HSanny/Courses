Lecture 17
********
1. No, Non interference is  stricter with respect to covert channels. Specifies the security of the sytem by stating which flows are allowed.
2. No interferance between each other since neither dominates each other.
3.No, NI is an information flow policy, meaning that it specifies the security system by stating which flows are allowed. if there is an illegal flow then there is a covert channel so it is not an NI.
4. A( low) and B (High)
********
Lecture 18
********

1. Because it specifies in general the direction that the information may flow. This does not give specific rules for subjects/objects.
2. It should only view this sequence of actions: l1, l2, l3, ...,lk
3. Interferences are very common, most involve low-level system attributes, and many interferences are benign.

********
Lecture 19
********

1.)
  Integrity in computer security encompasses who can write or modify information so we want to resolve the following issues.
  -Who is authorized to supply or modify data?
  -How to separate and protect assets?
  -How do you detect and/or correct erroneous or unauthorized
changes to data?
  -What about authorizations changing over time? 
  so integrity is more important for commercial settings.

2.)A company or individual in a commercial setting is worried about integrity since integrity relates to how much you trust an entity to produce, protect, or modify data. 

3.) Separation of Duty focus on completing a function and Separation of Function cannot complete the roles  of other people.

4.) We want recoverability and accountability of information.

5.)
-Users will not write their own programs, but use existing production software.
-Programmers develop and test applications on a nonproduction system, possibly using contrived data.
-Moving applications from development to production requires a special process
-This process must be controlled and audited.
-Managers and auditors must have access to system state and system logs.

6. In the commercial world

********
Lecture 20
********
1.) The New York Times: Wow: this is highly reliable with little sensitivity
    The National Enquirer: America declares war! is not highly reliable but highly sensible.

2.) 
  Row 1: Expert has higher reliabilty than student and the domains of expert is a superset or equal to the domain of the student.
  Row 2: There is no dominates relation since expert or novice have no categories that are superset or subset of each other.
  Row 3: Student is more reliable than a novice and the student's categories is a superset of the novice's categories.

3.) don’t allow information to “ﬂow up” in integrity.
4.) Orthogonality in this context means that they deal with aspects of information in diferent forms(directions). They have to be treated separately. 

********
Lecture 21
********
1.) Because there are two rules:
-Simple Integrity means that a subject can only read objects at its own integrity level or above
-The Integrity *-Property means that a subject can only write objects at its own integrity level or below.

2.) Because you cannot read or write since Subj3 does not dominate obj2 or Obj3 does not dominate subj3.

3.) No, An access is allowed only if allowed by both the BLP rules and the Biba rules.


********
Lecture 22
********
1.)A potential of the LWM Integrity policy is to monotonically decrease the integrity level of a subject unnecessarily.

2.)No

3.) It makes the assumption that the subject is trustworthy. 
4.)Yes

********
Lecture 23
********
1.) Yes only that they are in the same category but fall into differenct aspects. SD is for confidentiality and ID on integrity.

2.) We would have to change object labels and theres no obvious way to do that in BLP or Biba.

3.) yes.
4.)Weak tranquility 

********
Lecture 24
********
1.) The purpose of the four fundamental concerns is to yield a workable commercial policy.
    - Authentication
	  - Audit
	  - Well-formed transaction
	  - Separation of duty
2.) SSNs

3.) phone numbers
4.)Certification: Rules that give policies more validity.
   Enforcemtn: Rules that have to be followed by policies.

5.) A software product to be released.
********
Lecture 25
********
1.) The subject may access information from American Airlines and pass it to United Airlines.

2.)Yes,it is a different compnay in a different conflict class.

3.) Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citicorp
4.) The Chinese Wall is an access control policy in which is sensitive to the history of past accesses. Designed to address a very specific concern, interest by a consultant or contractor.

********
Lecture 26
********
1.)One role may subsume another, meaning that anyone having role rj can do at least the functions of ri.

2.) Active roles is the role that it currently occupies. Authorized roles is a role that is allowed to fill at various times.

3.) A subject’s active role must be an authorized role for that subject. Transaction authorization is a rule to execute a transaction if the transaxtion is authoriezd for one of the subject's active roles.
4.)Permissions are appropriate to the organization—”open an account” rather than “read a ﬁle.”
  -They are are more difficult to administer.

********
Lecture 27
********
1.)
  -The matrix would be huge for most realistic systems.
  -Store the permissions with objects. This is called an access control list (ACL).
  -Store the permissions with subjects. This is called a capability-based system.
2.)-Maintain a set of rules to compute access permissions “on the ﬂy” based on attributes of subjects and objects.

********
Lecture 28
********
1. -In some cases, it is possible to quantify the information content of a message.
   -Maybe an appropiate unit of information content is bits.
   -Sender and receiver must have some shared knowledge, included an agreed encoding scheme.
2. in our current context it is useful to know how much information can be transmitted over a specific covert channel. This is the “bandwidth” 	of the channel.If the bandwidth is sufficiently small, perhaps we want to ignore it, but if it’s large that suggests a potential problem.
3.To get efficient transmission. To reduce uncertainty.
4. To make the communication more efficient, that means using fewer bits to find an optimal encoding.
5.One bit. " yes" for 1 and "no" for 0.

********
Lecture 29
********
1. It depends on the Receiver's level of uncertainty.
2. The information content of a message is the amount of uncertainty it resolves. In this case: 
	If the only uncertainty were whether at dawn or dusk: one bit.
	If the attack could have come anytime during the day: ? bits.
	If the day was uncertain...: ? bits.
3.we represent all possible choices in any decision as the Leaves of a “complete” binary tree. then log2(16) = 4. So four bits of information must be transmited.
4.log2(256) = 8
5.It is hard to find an optimal encoding because of the number of uncertainties. The information content has to be big enough for the number of uncertainties it resolves.

********
Lecture 30
********
1.) one is discrete for binary digits and the other one is continous which is a quantity of information.
2.) 
	message    code
------------------------------
	M1 			  0000
	M2			  0001
	m3			  0010
	m4			  0011
	m5        0100
	m6			  0101
	m7			  0111

3.)Given 1000 messages, on average 995 of them will be message 10, and 5 will be other messages. This encoding takes 995 + (5 · 5) = 1020 bits or 1.02 bits per message.
4.)Because we want to use fewer bits to transmit messages in the language. so that uncertainties are much less.
5.

------------------------------
	M1 			0000
	M2			1000
	m3			1100
	m4			1110

6.It must possible to have the following properties: lossless, uniquely decodable and  streaming.

	2			  10
	3			  110
	4			  1110
	5       1111
	6			  11
3. We want to distinguish each code from each other.We don't want to spend much time to find out a match by having to "look ahead". We want to make it more efficient.  no longer code words begin with the identical digits making up any of the shorter code words.
4.it must be possible to recover the entire original
sequence of symbols from the transmission
5.It doesn't satisfy our criteria because it is not streaming.There's a break between each letter so can't distinguish.

********
Lecture 32
********
1. h = -(log 1/n) = log n = (log 1/8) = log 8 = 3, hence it requires 3 bits, on average, to transmit the result.

2.-(1/4 x log(1/4) + 4/4(log(1))) = -(-.5 + 0)= 0.5

3. Entropy sets a lower limit on encoding efficiency, measure the average information content of symbols. Overall provide a bound on the efficiency of any encoding.

Lecture 33
********
1. HH ~ 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16
   TH ~ 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16
   HT ~ 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16
   TT ~ 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16

2. count * (number of bits per code)  = bits 
total: 1*9 + (2*3)+ (3*3) + (1 * 3) = 27

	6				1/14	      11111

6. For any language, we want an efficient binary encoding that is lossless, uniquely decodable and streaming and so this is prefix-free and uniquely decodable
