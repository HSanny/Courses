Lecture 17:
	1. Yes. Any MLS policy can be turned into a Non-Interference policy, but not 
	vice versa.
	2. The NI policy would be that neither could interfere with each other. 
	There would be no flow. 
	3. No. Covert channels cannot exist because NI doesn't allow for interference 
	from high to low subjects. It makes sure that nothing that high subjects do 
	can be seen by low subjects
	4. The combinations are {(A-high, B-high), (A-low, B-high), (A-low, B-low)}. 

Lecture 18:
	1. NI is abstract. There aren't any specific rules about who can do what.
	2. l1,l2,l3,...,lk,....
	3. Interferences are very common, so realistic systems have many potential 
	interferences. Also, it's hard to identify and deal with some channels.

Lecture 19:
	1. Integrity is more context dependent than confidentiality. It is important 
	to know who can supply or change data, how to protect data from unauthorized 
	changes, and if authorizations can change over time.
	2. A company or individual may choose to purchase commerical software because 
	companies may have more integrity than free versions. Companies are regulated 
	and have paid experts. Free software doesn't have the same regulations or 
	expertise.
	3. Separation of duty means that there must be more than one subject completing 
	important functions, while separation of function centers on one subject and 
	that they cannot finish related roles in a critical process.
	4. Auditing is important to be able to know how much things are able to be 
	fixed and who is at fault or who can fix it.
	5. Lipner seems to be mainly concerned with separation of function. 
	6. Integrity could be more important than confidentiality in the context of 
	news outlets. The integrity of a source determines how valuable the product 
	supplying the news is.

Lecture 20:
	1. Highly reliable information with little sensitivity could be things like 
	encylopedias or textbooks. Information that is not so highly reliable but with 
	greater sensitivity could be rumors about the location of a high-value target 
	for the military.
	2. Expert:{Physics} dominates Student: {Physics} because Expert >= Student, and 
	Physics is a superset of Physics. Novice:{Physics, Art} doesn't dominate 
	Expert:{Physics} because Novice < Expert.  Student:{Art} dominates Novice:{} 
	because Student >= Novice and {} is a subset of Art.
	3. The flow in NI for integrity would be the opposite of that for 
	confidentiality, so a subject can't write up or read down in integrity.
	4. It means that confidentiality and integrity have to be taken into 
	consideration apart from each other. They can't have the same labels because 
	they aren't really related.

Lecture 21:
	1. The simple property and the *-property of each is the converse of the other.
	2. Neither dominates the other.
	3. No. Access is only permitted if confidentiality rules and integrity rules 
	are followed.

Lecture 22:
	1. The assumption is that once a subject has read low integrity information, 
	they cannot filter it and lose integrity themselves.
	2. No. The subjects are not considered trustworthy.
	3. The Ring policy makes the assumption that a subject can filter out what they 
	have read and maintain the same integrity levels.
	4. Yes. The subjects are considered trustworthy.

Lecture 23:
	1. No. They are both Development categories but for different aspects of 
	security. They don't get measured against each other.
	2. It is necessary because labels need to be changed. BLP and Biba don't 
	specify a way to do that.
	3. No. Confidentiality doesn't allow for it.
	4. Weak tranquility.

Lecture 24:
	1. The purpose of the four fundamental concerns is to create a workable model 
	for commercial integrity.
	2. Private personal information of customers, bank information, pricing etc.
	3. Information entered into a system by users, taking candy from the free 
	candy bowl.
	4. (Manager, Change Pricing TP, {Product Pricing})

Lecture 25:
	1. There could be a conflict of interests. The companies are competing 
	companies.
	2. Yes. You already accessed GM files, so they are already "within the wall".
	3. GM, Microsoft and only one from the following conflict class {Bank of 
	America, Wells Fargo, Citicorp}.
	4. The Chinese Wall policy is specific and depends on past accesses rather than 
	sensitivity levels.

Lecture 26:
	1. Associating permissions with roles makes it easy in the sense that all 
	subjects in the same role have the same permissions and subjects can have 
	multiple roles.
	2. Authorized roles are the roles that a subject is allowed to fill. Active 
	roles are the roles a subject currently occupies that is a subset of their 
	authorized roles.
	3. Transaction authorizations specify the transactions allowed for an active 
	role while role authorizations specify the roles allowed for a subject.
	4. Standard access control policies are not as flexible as RBAC. Standard 
	access control doesn't easily allow for a subject to have many roles or change 
	roles as the same identity.

Lecture 27:
	1. An ACM is expensive and ACLs or collections of capabilities can work as 
	well.
	2. Access control lists,  collections of capabilities in capability-based 
	systems, having a set of rules to compute on the fly.

Lecture 28:
	1. The sender and receiver need to have some shared knowledge.	
	2. To know how fast something can be sent, or how much information can be sent 
	over a covert channel.
	3. The sender and reveiver must have some shared knowledge and an agreed 
	encoding scheme in order to reliably understand each other.
	4. The sender wouldn't want to transmit more data than necessary so that there 
	are fewer vulnerabilities or chances for others to access that data or to have 
	a larger bandwidth.
	5. No bits are needed because the answer is already known.

Lecture 29:
	1. N bits, 4 bits, 7 bits.
	2. The reveiver could know that the attack is only at 2 different times, 100 
	different times, a million. The amount of information that needs to be sent 
	depends on how many different answers a receiver can expect.
	3. 4 bits. 4 bits can represent all digits from 0 to 15, which is 16 different 
	messages. The receiver can have numbers representing which of the 16 messages 
	should be sent.
	4. 8 bits.
	5. You don't always know what messages could be sent, so your encodings may 
	have to be long (ASCII, etc).

Lecture 30:
	1. Bit1 is just a binary digit. It is a 0 or 1. Bit2 is the amount of 
	information in a message.
	2. 

	M0- 000
	M1- 001
	M2- 010
	M3- 011
	M4- 100
	M5- 101
	M6- 110
	M7- 111

	3. It takes that many bits because the most common message only needs 1 bit to 
	be sent. The others need 5 bits because they use the naive encoding plus an 
	extra bit to distinguish them from the common message. So since around 99.5% of 
	the time, the common message will be sent, only 995 bits are needed for 995 
	messages. The other 0.5% needs 5 bits each, hence the (5*5).
	4. It can lead to a more efficient encoding because if a message is very 
	common, it can use less bits, while the less common ones will use more bits. 
	The average number of bits sent will be less.
	5. A worse encoding than the naive encoding would be to use 4 bits for each 
	possible message. It would basically be the naive encoding but with an extra 2 
	zeros at the front of each.
	6. The average number of bits that need to be sent will be less, so more 
	information will cross a channel per second.

Lecture 31:
	1. 264846842684284.
	2. 
	 
	S1-11111
	S2-10 
	S3-110
	S4-1110
	S5-11110
	S6-111110

	3. An encoding must be uniquely decodable so that the reciever always 
	understands what the correct, intended message is.
	4. Lossless is desirable because we don't want a loss of information. We are 
	trying to get a full message accross fully and efficiently.
	5. Morse code doesn't satisfy the criteria for encoding because it isn't 
	uniquely decodable. It has to have breaks to be decodable, but streaming is a 
	property we desire (we shouldn't have breaks).

Lecture 32: 
	1. -(log(1/8)) where log is base 2. 
	   = log(8) = 3
	2. -{(1/5)log(1/5) + (4/5)log(4/5)}
	3. Knowing the entropy lets you set a lower limit on how efficient you can 
	encode.

Lecture 33:
	1. The expectations make sense because the probability is out of 16ths and 
	since 32 flips is equivalent to 16 pairs of flips, the probabilities correspond 
	exactly to the 2flips. So 9/16 of 2flips will be HH, and so on.
	2. The expected number of bits is 27 because the number of bits it takes for 
	each 2flip is 1,2,3 and 3. So since we expect 9 HH, we can use only one bit to 
	represent each HH 2flip, which means half a bit per H in this particular case. 
	HH has a count of 9 with only 1 bit to code, giving the expectation of 9 bits. 
	HT has a count of 3 with 2 bits to code, giving the expectation of 6, as does 
	TH. TT has a count of 1 with 3 bits to code, giving 3 bits. The total is 27 
	bits expected.
	3. The naive encoding is:
	
	S1-001
	S2-010
	S3-011
	S4-100
	S5-101
	S6-110

	4. The probabilities are:

	S1-6/20
	S2-6/20
	S3-3/20
	S4-3/20
	S5-1/20
	S6-1/20

	The entropy is: -{(6/20)log(6/20) + (6/20)log(6/20) + (3/20)log(3/20) + 
	(3/20)log(3/20) + (1/20)log(1/20) + (1/20)log(1/20)} ~= 2.295

	5. More efficient encoding:

	S1-00
	S2-01
	S3-100
	S4-101
	S5-110
	S6-111
	
	6. Expected from naive: 60 bits per 20 rolls
	   Expected from mine: 48 bits per 20 rolls, which is close to the entropy x 20 
	   rolls = (45.9)
