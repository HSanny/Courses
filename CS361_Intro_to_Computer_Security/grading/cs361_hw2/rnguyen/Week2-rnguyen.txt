Lecture 17
1) It does comply because low subjects can communicate to high subjects just like in the NI policy.
2) They wouldn't be able to send information to each other.
3) I'm sure there are operations not meant for their created intention could be used to send unwanted information a lower level subject.
4) B is the high subject and A is the low subject. A is allowed to send information to B. 

Lecture 18
1) It resembles the confidentiality metapolicy in that information can flow, but it doesn't specify any rules in what way it can flow like policies do.
2) It would have to be l1, l2, l3, ....lk
3) If you made the system extremely inclusive, it would be impossible to prove that it's non-interfering. You would also have to have a model of low-level system attributes. And many files that interferes are encrypted.

Lecture 19
1) Changing data to incorrect data can lose the trusts of the people reading the data. Low integrity will have people less inclined to retrieve that data.
2) The commercial software may have more integrity to produce the results the company really wants.
3) Separation of duty requires several subjects for one function while separation of function requires a single subject cannot do several sensitive functions.
4) So you can go back to see the source of the problem should it arise and fix it accordingly.
5) The users shouldn't be making their own programs and and developers shouldn't be working on customer data. 
6) A highly regarded newspaper that provides reliable information.

Lecture 20
1) I could say 1+1 is 2 because I went to elementary school which would be high integrity but low sensitivity. Then I could say Obama is racist which would be low integrity but high sensitivity because I don't know Obama and racism is a sensitive subject matter.
2) Expert is a higher level than student in the same set of physics so the label 1 dominates label 2. A novice is a low level than expert so label 1 does not dominate label 2 in the second row. And a student with a superset of a novice with an empty set is dominating that novice so label 1 dominates label 2.
3) Subjects can interfere with an object if object dominates the subject.
4) They aren't related. A subject/object can have a high confidentiality label but a low integrity label.

Lecture 21
1) The dominance relation is opposite in the strict policy and BLP.
2) Subject 3 and Object 3 does not dominate one another so you can't read or write.
3) No because it has to pass both clearances.

Lecture 22
1) The subject's integrity may change depending on the level of integrity they read.
2) The subjects are not considered trustworthy in this case.
3) The subject will filter out bad information
4) The subject is trusted to not lower their integrity level.

Lecture 23
1) They are both development categories under confidentiality and integrity respectively
2) So that they can transfer software from the development house to the production house
3) No they should not be able to modify the data it is downgrading.
4) The downgrade reflects the weak tranquility property.

Lecture 24
1) To keep the integrity of the object and fix any problems should they arise.
2) bank balances, inventory, work hours.
3) free samples, water from a fountain.
4) Certifications are checks such as ensuring CDIs are valid and logging operations. Enforcements are rules for certain operations.
5) (John, transfer money to bank, {checking account})

Lecture 25
1) The consultant may have sensitive information about the competing company.
2) Yes because you can access information from different conflict classes but not the other companies within the same conflict class.
3) You would be able to access GM, Microsoft, and either Bank of America, Wells Fargo, or Citicorp
4) The Chinese Wall policy uses conflict classes by using companies as clearance instead of labels. It also checks what you write and can read from another conflict class.

Lecture 26
1) Roles can have all the same permissions instead of assigning individuals their individual roles. 
2) Authorized roles are roles given to an individual in order to do an operation and an active role is the role that the individual currently occupies. 
3) Role authorization must have its role within its authorization roles and transaction authorization are operations that can only be done if your authorization roles allows it.
4) You have to assign each individual their permissions, the operations of an individual is fixed and you can't assign new roles in order to do necessary operations.

Lecture 27
1) There may not be any associativity from many subjects to many object. 
2) Creating an access control list, subject capability list, and computing permissions based on a subject's and object's level.

Lecture 28
1) That the sender has an answer and wants to send it to the receiver and the receiver has to know how to interpret the answer.
2) So we can know how much information is going through, for example in covert channels.
3) So that they can communicate if at all.
4) You can prevent any noise and use less bandwidth to convey the same information.
5) Just one bit because there are only two options and there are two different options for bits.

Lecture 29
1) n bits for first one, 4 bits for the second, and 7 bits for the third.
2) The receiver would have to decode what the message is depending on how many different bits of information represent a ascii character. Or 1 bit depending on how the receiver interprets the information.
3) 4 bits because there are 16 possibilities for 4 bits of information and each message could be assigned to each possibility.
4) 8 bits 
5) The sender would also have to send the receiver the encoding protocol to decode what the bits represent.

Lecture 30
1) Bits can be a binary digit 0 or 1. It can also be a quantity of information, the measure of information content.
2) Use 3 bits so that there are 8 different options and assign them a message.
3) There are 995 bits to determine that it’s message 10, and (5 * 5) bits to determine which of the 5 other messages it is. So to get the 1000 messages you can send 1020 bits.
4) If you know one message has a higher probability, you can just look at the first bit and decide if it’s one of the higher probability messages instead of going through at all the bits.
5) Using 3 bits, the first bit to determine if it’s a particular 2 out of the 4 messages and then using the last 2 bits to determine that message.
6) The machine is working properly, and the probabilities of having a certain message is reliable and accurate.

Lecture 31
1) “24684268864”
2) 1 for 1, 0 for 2, 10 for 3, 01 for 4, 101 for 5, 010 for 6
3) So that you can accurately decode the message and not mistake a code for different symbols.
4) So there isn’t lost information.
5) Morse code is not streaming. It has breaks in the code. 

Lecture 32
1) 3 entropy
2) -[4/5log(4/5) + 1/5log(1/5)]
3) It tells you how much information you’re sending and can determine if the encoding is optimal.

Lecture 33
1) The probability of two independent events are the multiple of the probabilities.
2) You get the sum of the probability of an event happening times the number of bit it takes to code that message.
3) The naive encoding is using 3 bits with 2 extra encodings. The other 6 encodings represent a die roll.
4) -[3/11log(3/11) + 3/11log(3/11) + 3/22log(3/22) 3/22log(3/22) + 1/11log(1/11) + 1/11log(1/11)] 
5) 00 for 1, 01 for 2, 100 for 3, 101 for 4, 110 for 5, 111 for 6
6) It uses less bits for the highest probability message and the same amount for the rest, thus using less bits.
