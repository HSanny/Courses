Questions Week 2

Lecture 17.
	1Q. If a computer system complies with the BLP model, does it necessarily comply with non-interference? Why or why not?
		1A. Yes, any BLP model can be a non-interference policy. But not necessarily backwards, ie: a non-transitive non-interference.

	2Q. What would the NI policy be for a BLP system with subjects: A at (Secret: Crypto), B at (Secret: Nuclear)?
		2A. neither subject would be able to interfere with each other.

	3Q. Can covet channels exist in an NI policy? Why or why not?
		3A.Yes, if a particular attribute is overlooked in the policy.

	4Q. If the NI policy is A -> B, in a BLP system what combinations of the levels "high" and "low" could A and B have?
		4A. A-low, B-High; A-high, B-high; A-low, B-low

Lecture 18.
	1Q. Why do NI policies better resemble metapolicies than policies?
		1A. They just show a simplified information flow not individual rules regarding actions in the policy.

	2Q. What would be L's view of the following actions: h1,l1,h2,h3,...,hj,l2,l3,...,lk
		2A. l1,l2,l3,..lk

	3Q. What is difficult about proving NI for realistic systems?
		3A.  There are a lot of interferences in systems, most of which are low-level.  

Lecture 19.
	1Q. Explain the importance of integrity in various contexts.
		1A. Any context where you don't want information to be changed by an outside source, such as Bank information ie: a balance, or your grades in the UT grading systems.

	2Q. Why would a company or individual opt to purchase commercial software rather than download a similar, freely available version?
		2A. The commercial software has a higher integrity than the freely available version. 

	3Q. Explain the difference between separation of duty and separation of function.
		3A. Separation of duty is multiple subjects must be involved for one function.
			Separation of function is that there could not be the same subject on complementary roles within a critical process.

	4Q. What is the importance of auditing in integrity contexts?
		4A. They are records you keep that could be used in emergency to see what messed up and how to roll-back if needed.

	5Q. What are the underlying ideas that raise the integrity concerns of Lipner?
		5A. Separation of Duty, Separation of Function, and Auditing in a commercial data processing environment.

	6Q.Name a common scenario where integrity would be more important than confidentiality.
		6A. The grades within the UT system. A student might be able to see grades, confidentiality, but cannot change it, integrity.

Lecture 20.
	1Q. Give examples of information that is highly reliable with little sensitivity and information that is not so highly reliable with greater sensitivity.
		1A. Highly reliable /Little Sensitivity -  UT grades.
			Little reliable /High Sensitivity -  HR complaints, everyone should be able to make one but they should not be visible to large amount of people.

	2Q. Explain the dominates relationships for each row in the table on slide 4.
		2A. An Expert dominates a Student when they are within the same subject,
			A novice in a superset of an expert's categories cannot beat said expert.
			A student in a superset of a novice's categories can dominate said novice.

	3Q. Construct the NI policy for the integrity metapolicy.
		3A. High -> low

	4Q. What does it mean that confidentiality and integrity are "orthogonal issues?"
		4A. Their labels don't mix, you can't use the same label for both integrity and confidentiality.

Lecture 21.
	1Q. Why is Biba Integrity called the "dual" of the BLP model?
		1A. It is read up, write down. It has the opposite direction of BLP.

	2Q. Why in the ACM on slide 5 is the entry for Subj3 - Obj3 empty?
		2A. L,{A,B} and L,{B,C} can not dominate each other since they have different categories.

	3Q. If a subject satisfies confidentiality requirements but fails integrity requirements of an object, can the subject access the object?
		3A. No.

Lecture 22.
	1Q. What is the assumption about subjects in BIba's low water mark policy?
		1A. If a subject reads a lower leveled integrity object, the subject's integrity level drops. 

	2Q. Are the subjects considered trustworthy?
		2A. No.

	3Q. Does the Ring policy make some assumption about the subject that the LWM policy does not?
		3A. A subject can read anything and it could filter out bad information.

	4Q. Are the subjects considered trustworthy?
		4A. Yes.

Lecture 23.
	1Q. Are the SD and ID categories in Lipner's model related to each other?
		1A. Yes they both fall within development.

	2Q. Why is it necessary for system controllers to have to ability to downgrade?
		2A. So you can transfer the software from Development to production.

	3Q. Can system controllers modify development code /test data?
		3A. no

	4Q. What form of tranquility underlies the downgrade ability?
		4A. weak

Lecture 24.
	1Q. What is the purpose of the four fundamental concerns of Clark and Wilson?

		2A. Bank balance, Credit card numbers.

	3Q. What are some possible examples of UDI's in a commercial setting?
		3A. Candy in a dentist office or Free samples at Costco.

	4Q. What is the difference between certification and enforcement rules?
		4A. certification, certifies that an object is in a valid state, and enforcement rules enforce the valid state of already certified objects.

	5Q. Give an example of a permission in a commercial setting?
		5A. A secretary schedules appointments in a dentist's itinerary.
			(secretary, schedules appointment, {itinerary})

Lecture 25.
	1Q. Why would a consultant hired by American AirLines potentially have a breach of confidentiality if also hired by United Airlines?
		1A. The consultant might know insider secrets from AA.

	2Q. In the example conflict classes, if you accessed a file from GM, then subsequently accessed a file from Microsoft, will you then be able to access another file from GM?
		2A. Yes. If it was Ford or Chrysler you can't.

	3Q. Following the previous question, what companies' files are available for access according to the simple security rule?
		3A.Those not in Microsoft's or GM's conflict classes.

	4Q. What differences separate the Chinese Wall policy from the BLP model?
		4A. It is sensitive to the past. Your access depends on what files you have accessed in the past.

Lecture 26.
	1Q. What benefits are there in associating permissions with roles, rather than subjects?
		1A. It recognizes that a subject can have various functions and can allow subjects to transition between roles without having to change identities.

	2Q. What is the difference between authorized roles and active roles?
		2A. authorized - roles it CAN take
			active - roles it IS taking

	3Q. What is the difference between role authorization and transaction authorization?
		3A.	authorization - an Active role must have authorization
			transaction - Can only execute transaction if it is one of the active roles.

	4Q. What disadvantages do standard access control policies have when compared to RBAC?
		4A. It is harder to do a SACP rather than an RBAC if there is a lot of subjects. It is also less flexible and doesn't have the features in L26.1A.

Lecture 27.
	1Q. Why would one not want to build an explicit ACM for an access control system?
		1A. It could grow rather large.

	2Q. Name, in order, the ACM alternatives for storing permissions with objects, storing permissions with subjects and computing permissions on the fly.
		2A. access control list, capability-based system, implicitly as a series of rules.

Lecture 28.
	1Q. What must be true for the receiver to interpret the answer to a "yes" or "no" question?
		1A. The sender and receiver must share some agreed encoding scheme.

	2Q. Why would one want to quantify the information content of a message?
		2A. It would be useful to know how to categorize certain covert channels, depending on bandwidth.

	3Q. Why must the sender and receiver have some shared knowledge and an agreed encoding scheme?
		3A. So they could be able to understand their communication 

	4Q. Why wouldn't the sender want to transmit more data than the receiver needs to resolve uncertainty?
		4A. You want to be efficient as possible.

	5Q. If the receiver knows the answer to a question will be "yes", how many bits of data quantify the information content? Explain.
		5A. 1

Lecture 29.
	1Q. How much information is contained in each of the first three messages from slide 2?
		1A.2^n , 4bits or 3. something, 7 bits 

	2Q. Why does the amount of information contained in "The attack is at dawn" depend on the receiver's level of uncertainty?
		2A. There are a lot of ways it could be interpreted ie: dawn or dusk, or any time for example.

	3Q. How many bits of information must be transmitted for a sender to send one of exactly 16 messages? Why?
		3A. 4 because, 4 bits have 16 different possible patterns. 

	4Q. How much information content is contained in a message from a space of 256 messages?
		4A. log(256) or 8

	5Q. Explain why very few circumstances are ideal, in terms of sending information content.
		5A. You may not know how many messages can be sent. 

Lecture 30.
	1Q. Explain the difference between the two connotations of the term "bit."
		1A. Theres discrete, a binary digit (o or 1)
			Theres also continuous, a quantity of information.

	2Q. Construct the naive encoding for 8 possible messages.
		2A. M1-000
			M2-001
			M3-010
			M4-011
			M5-100
			M6-101
			M7-110
			M8-111

	3Q. Explain why the encoding on slide 5 takes 995 + (5*5) bits.
		3A. Out of 1000 times, 995 it takes one bit while the other 5 times it takes 5 bits. 

	4Q. How can knowing the prior probabilities of messages lead to a more efficient encoding?
		4A.You can limit the average length of the message by sending smaller messages for the more probable messages.

	5Q. Construct an encoding for 4 possible messages that is worse than the naive encoding.
		5A."one" ,"two" ,"three", "four", ..., "five-hundred"

	6Q. What are some implications if it is possible to find an optimal encoding?
		6A. It limits the bandwidth required for information.

Lecture 31.
	1Q. Name a string in the language consisting of positive, even numbers.
		1A."24682222864"

	2Q. Construct a non-prefix-free encoding for the possible rolls of a 6-sided die.
		2A.	1 - 001
			2 - 010
			3 - 011
			4 - 100
			5 - 101
			6 - 111

	3Q. Why is it necessary for an encoding to be uniquely decodable?
		3A. We need each code to correspond to one symbol. If it doesn't the whole encoding scheme breaks down.

	4Q. Why is a lossless encoding scheme desirable?
		4A. We want to be able to completely recover the information after the encoding /decoding

	5Q. Why doesn't Morse code satisfy our criteria for encodings?
		5A. It is not continuous, it has breaks.

Lecture 32.
	1Q. Calculate the entropy of an 8-sided, fair die (all outcomes are equally likely).
		1A. 1

	2Q. If an unbalanced coin is 4 times more likely to yield a tail than a head, what is the entropy of the language?
		2A. h = -(0.2*log(0.2) + 0.8*log(0.8))

	3Q. Why is knowing the entropy of a language important?
		3A. The entropy gives you a measure of the best possible encoding for a given language.

Lecture 33.
	1Q. Explain the reasoning behind the expectations presented in slide 3.
		1A. The expectation for a given event is just the Probability times the amount of events. so P*NumofEvents=(9/16)*16=9 for example.

	2Q. Explain why the total expected number of bits is 27 in the example presented in slide 4.
		2A. The total expected number of bits is just the summation of the Counts*sizeOf(code) for every code. So it would be Sum(Count*Code) = 1*9 + 3*2 + 3*3 + 1*3 = 27.

	3Q. What is the naive encoding for the language in slide 5.
		3A. 1 - 000
			2 - 001
			3 - 010
			4 - 011

			6 - 101

	4Q. What is the entropy of this language?
		4A. h = -(((.05*log2(.05) +.05*log2(.05)+.15*log2(.15)+.15*log2(.15) +.3*log2(.3)+.3*log2(.3))) ~= 2.29546184424

	5Q. Find an encoding more efficient than naive encoding for this language.
		5A. 1 - 10
			2 - 11
			3 - 010
			4 - 011
			5 - 0010
			6 - 0011

	6Q. Why is your encoding more efficient than the naive encoding?
		6A. For the naive it was 60/20 = 3 bits/symbols.
			The more efficent one was 50/20 ~= 2.5 bits/symbols on average.
