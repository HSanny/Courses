Lecture 17
1. Yes, any MLS policy can be turned into a Non-Interference policy and BLP is a MLS policy 
2. Neither can interfere with the other
3. No, there should be no visible difference in the system state caused by actions of "higher-level" subjects
4. A low/B high

Lecture 18
1. No rules about reads/writes; NI policies very abstract
2. l1, l2, l3, ..., lk
3. Requires identifying within the view function all potential channels of information, realistic systems have many such channels

Lecture 19
1. Who can supply data, separate assets, detect unauthorized changes, changes in authorization
2. Commercial software a more trustworthy source; company is accountable
3. Duty: several subjects must be involved to complete a function; Function: single subject can't complete complementary roles within a process
4. Making sure that breaches of integrity can be recovered from
5. Ensuring that someone can be held accountable for security breaches
6. Bank teller writing arbitrary balance into his own account

Lecture 20
1. New York Times/The National Enquirer
2. Row 1: Expert > Student, Row 2: Novice < Expert, Row 3: {Art} not a subset of {} 
3. Lower integrity subjects cannot interfere with higher integrity subjects, but higher integrity subjects can interfere with lower integrity subjects.
4. They are analagous but their labels are not interchangable.

Lecture 21
1. Direction of arrows in SSP and *P just changed.
2. Neither set is a subset of the other set
3. No

Lecture 22
1. Subjects can't determine bad information from good information
2. No
3. Subjects will know how good the information they take in is
4. Yes

Lecture 23
1. No
2. Allows software to be moved from development to production
3. No
4. Weak Tranquility

Lecture 24
1. Blame can be assigned in case of breaches
2. Bank balances
3. Mints on the counter
4. Certification ensures validity of TPs, Enforcement makes sure Certification is followed
5. Someone in a bank who is allowed to move funds between accounts

Lecture 25
1. Could carry AA information with them to UA
2. Yes
3. BoA, WF, Citicorp, Microsoft, GM
4. Can move between class groups but not within them (opposite of BLP,) permissions change dynamically

Lecture 26
1. Associates permissions with general functions within an organization rather than individuals
2. Active = currently assumed, Authorized = may at some point assume
3. Active roles must be Authorized, Transactions must be authorized for some Active role
4. More general and easy to manage, allows for subjects to have various functions, easier transition between roles

Lecture 27
1. Expensive to store a large/sparse matrix
2. Access Control List, Capability-Based System, Maintain a set of rules (like with BLP)

Lecture 28
1. Must know whether 0 represents yes or no
2. Useful to know how much information might be transmitted over a covert channel
3. At minimum requires that both understand what 0 and 1 represent
4. Would not know if rest of data is another answer or what to do with it
5. 0, no new information is being passed in the answer

Lecture 29
1. 1: n bits; 2: 4 bits; 3: 8 bits
2. Depends on how many possibilities the receiver thinks there are for attack times
3. 4
4. 8
5. Most of the time you won't know how many possible messages could be sent

Lecture 30
1. Can either be discrete (0 or 1) or continuous (some quantity of information)
2.
M1 000
M2 001
M3 010
M4 011
M5 100
M6 101
M7 110
M8 111
3. 99.55% of the time it will only send 1 bit, .5% of the time it will send 5 bits
4. More likely messages can be made to require that fewer bits be sent
5.
M1 111
M2 110
M3 100
M4 000
6. Would mean that you could find the most efficient encoding for the language

Lecture 31
1. 1,2,3
2. 
R1 1
R2 0
R3 10
R4 11
R5 101
R6 111
3. So only one possible message can be determined from any encoding
4. So data isn't lost in the transfer
5. Not streaming (breaks between letters)

Lecture 32
1. -8*1/8*log(1/8) = 3
2. -(4/5*log(4/5) + 1/5*log(1/5)) = .4
3. Can't find an encoding that does any better on average than the entropy

Lecture 33
1. Each flip is independent of the other flips so probabilities are multiplied
2. 9 bits come from HH + 6 bits come from HT + 9 bits come from TH + 3 bits come from TT = 27 bits total
3.
R1 000
R2 001
R3 010
R4 011
R5 100
R6 101
4. 2.46
5.
R1 0
R2 1
R3 00
R4 01
R5 11
R6 000
6. R1 and R2 will be the most common result and transmit the fewest bits.
