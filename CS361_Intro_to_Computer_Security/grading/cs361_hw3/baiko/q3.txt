1. you go faster than allowed
2. separates message from noise

35.
1. 3.32
2. complex models
3. zero assumes everything occurs equally. one takes letter into account second takes words into account etc. every new order is different.

36.
1. its different for everyone
2. if you know the content of the message than it doesn't contain any usefulness to you.
3. less errors the closer you get to entropy.


37.
1. it is encoded but easily breakable if you know the key span.
2. you can guess and check that doesn't require a key.
3. it changes how it looks but the message is still there.
4. it can notice patterns and patterns allows you to decipher.

38.
1.p
2.d(e,d)
3. thats how you break code
4. you can see patterns better

39.
1. may just take to long
2. brute force
3. the combination is deadly
4. confusion shifts while diffusion upsets
5. diffusion



40
1.mono is a simple subsitiont
poly is a movement substitiuion.
2. replace one value with another
3. there are that many posibilityes . k*k-1*k-2 etc
4. value+3
5.no
6. 26
7. no
8. four score and seven years ago


41.
1.because 26^3
2. bceause they are allow 25*26*26 different possible ways those could occur
3. yes one time pad


42.
1. it doesnt give any insight as to the method of encryption.
2. because it allows randomness.
3. how do you share keys?


43.
1. teh text doesnt change just moves.


44.
1. asmmetric
2. key distrubition is sharing the key management is who gets the key
3. no they can only send messages.
4. i think asymmetric algorithms are better allows more confidentiality 

45.
1. because it is easier to change a block of text than a sequential stream.
2. malleability allows non unique decoding
3. code can only be transformed in one way



46.
1. mix columns. replaces columns by a value
2.shift rows shifts the each row by a incremented value
3. it goes through multiple rounds for different bits.
4. blocks can changed through rounds each time.
5.it makes the text harder to invert.




47.
1. observed changes and content leak
2. using it in a key stream generation mode
3. a naive use of encryption leaves too much regulatrity in the ciphertext
4. the key stream is like a one time pad but the block encryption generates text that can be recoverable



48.
1. the private key
2. the allow the user to generate a very hard ciphertext that is hard to invert.
3. computation takes 10000 times as long as a symmetric encryption. 
4.p
5. assymetric algorithms are less effecient than symmetric ones because symmetric ones remain the work horse of commericial cryptography while assymetric encryption plays a function in the background.


49
1.yes because they have been switched.
2. they arent divisible by anything so it doesn't hash to the same function.
3. yes
4. because they need the private key to read it.
5. because someone knowing the public key and send information posing as him.
6. if a can decrypt it using kb then a can be sure oit orginated from b.
7, they know his private key and public key.
8. pd of e = p = p e of d


50
1.keep it simple stupid.
2.a strong collision resistant is if it is hard to find two messages such that both in the function give the same message. a weak collision resistance is given a input that is different than another input but still produces the same value in a given function.
3.preimage resistance is knowing what it says, find a message under a equation that gives its value if knowing the input, finding another input that is still equal to it.
4.it means that the chance of finding a pair of arguments will be easier.
5. the hash value will be computed within 1.25sqrtH.
6. they are more about integrity and being tamper proof than being seen.
7.they compute the hash function and see if it is the same after being calculated again
8.using md5. 



51
1.Yes he can send the message but someone can decrypt it using rs public key.
2.yes but someone can take s's key and send something to r.
3.no
4.a sender a receiver , two public keys and two private keys that allow each to encrypt a message and decipher. a symmetric cipher of sorts.

52
1. It wouldn't be able to do much because if the # prime is large enough it would take more than a lifetime to figure it out.
2. He would be write as person a.
3. depends on if he knew a. if he knew b he would be able to send stuff to a.
