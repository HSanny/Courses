Questions Week 3

----------------------------------Lecture 34 Questions------------------------
1. Because the enttropy, h, is already the best encoding possible. If you were able to transmit a signal at greater than C/h symbols per second then you found an encoding scheme which is better than the entropy which cannot happen.

2. Because there is more of a chance that the message will eventually get through.

----------------------------------Lecture 35 Questions------------------------
1. According to the zero order model, using zero memory, each number is equaly likely. So the entropy = -(log2(1/10)). 

2. Because of the redundancy in each language as well as calculating the frequency of sybol use.

3. Zero order model is zero memory as assumes that every symbol is equally likely. First order model uses the frequency of each letter to calculate a more accurate entropy and is also zero memory. High order model uses frequency as well as digrams and trigrams, calculating the frequency that certain letters are pair together, to find the entropy.

----------------------------------Lecture 36 Questions------------------------
1. There are too many factors in play to compute the outcome of an event.

2. Because the more an observer knows, the less information the observer needs to reduce uncertainty. 

3. Understanding the redundancy of a language will help compute an encoding near the entropy of the language. 

----------------------------------Lecture 37 Questions------------------------ONTO MODULE 9
1. There are a lot of eights and a lot of fours in the message. If it is simple substitution this could mean those numbers could be common letters.

2. Because in some cases the keys may not be the same. They also depend on the algorithm

3. It should have no affect on the information content. It must be preserved.

4. An attacker can look at the redundancy and guess what they might be substituted for.

----------------------------------Lecture 38 Questions------------------------
1. P

2. E(P, KE)

3. It would help them figure out the algorithm used for encryption.

4. Redundancy in language would help the cryptanalyst if they knew the language of the message.

----------------------------------Lecture 39 Questions------------------------
1. Because a key of a large ammount of bits could take an unfeasable ammount of time to break.

2. A linear search of the keyspace of a length n-bit key will take an average of 2^n-1 operations.

3. Almost all modern commercial symmetric ciphers use substitution and transposition combinations.

4. Confusion is replacing symbols in a plaintext so that an attacker attempting to interpret the text cannot. And diffusion is spreading information form the source text so that it is not all together in the ciphertext.

5. Neither is better than the other, but work well together. 

----------------------------------Lecture 40 Questions------------------------MODULE 10
1. A polyalphabetic cipher does not substitute uniformly as a monoalphabetic cipher does.

2. How you map the symbols in a simple substitution. 

3. Because there are k! permutations of a k character alphabet.

4. The key is a mapping of each letter to itself shifted by a fixed amount.

5. The keyspace is the number of letters in the alphabet since it is monoalphabetic.

6. No, the reflected redundancy of simple substitution make it weak. 

7. Each symbol in the ciphertext will correspond to a pair of symbols. To decrypt you will have to seperate the pairs into seperate strings resulting in the key and the plaintext.

----------------------------------Lecture 41 Questions------------------------
1. Because knowing that there are three characters in a string, and each can be one of 26 choices, the possible decryptions are 26^3.

2. Since the second two characters are the same and since it is a simple substitution cipher, you will be able to tell that the first is non repeating. For the first letter you will have 26 choices, and for the second only 25. 

3. No, knowing the encryption algorithm will be an important tool that will reduce an attackers uncertainty.

----------------------------------Lecture 42 Questions------------------------
1. Because knowing the ciphertext and the encryption algorithm does not reduce the possible plaintext space. Any three bit string applied with the right key can produce the ciphertext.

2. Knowing anything about the key can help reduce the possible plaintext, making the cipher not perfect. 

3. The sender and the reciever both need to have the key, but sending it means it can be intercepted if there is not a secure channel. But if you have a secure channel you do not need a key.

----------------------------------Lecture 43 Questions------------------------
1. The frequencies of symbols are still preserved.

----------------------------------Lecture 44 Questions------------------------
1.  A one time pad is a symmetric algorithm.

2. Key distribution deals with how to communicate a key from one party to another securely, and key management is about how to keep track of a large number of keys so that they are available when they are needed but also secure from those who are not supposed to have them.

3. No, Ks is only the encryption key which is public. They would need the inverse or decryption key which is private to S.

4. It is difficult to tell. A symmetric key requires generating a lot more keys in a system and encounters the key distribution problem, but the keys are simple to generate, while an asymmetric system requires a much more comlex key that is expensive to generate. 

----------------------------------Lecture 45 Questions------------------------
1. Because they encrypt groups of plaintext which is immune to tampering.

2. Malleability can cause the meaning of the plaintext to change.

3. It allows you to get the key algorithm from ciphertext.

----------------------------------Lecture 46 Questions------------------------
1. subBytes is uses confusion by exchanging the value of a symbol by one i a lookup table. mixColumns uses confusion by replacing the columns of the state. addRoundKey uses confusion  by changing the key.

2. shiftRows uses diffusion by shifting the byte order of the rows of the state.

3. It takes longer because you have to multiply by the inverse of the mixColumn array which is time consuming. 

4. Blocks are used to take 16 bytes of information at a time and rounds is the process of encrypting them. 

5. To make the encryption stronger.

----------------------------------Lecture 47 Questions------------------------
1. Identical blocks in the plaintext will result in identical blocks in the ciphertext.

2. Randomize the plaintext blocks before you encrypt them, as in using a cipher block chain.

3. An attacker can gather information about the plaintext by viewing the ciphertext.

4. The cipher is used more as a random number generator. 

----------------------------------Lecture 48 Questions------------------------
1. The private key used for decryption.

2. Because they are difficult to invert.

3. Because you can easily distribute the public key without it being a security issue. 

4. You end up with the decrypted version of P.

5. Asymmetric algorithms take longer to encrypt because they are more complex. 

----------------------------------Lecture 49 Questions------------------------
1. Yes because you can use either key for encryption or decryption because the way the keys are used in a symmetric fashion.

2. Because it makes the multiplication process harder to reverse.

3. Yes given enough time.

4. Because only a has the key to decrypt the message.

5. Because anyone can have the public key and send the message to a.

6. No one besides B has the private key.

7. Because anyone can have B's public key.

8. You have multiple keys. One for authenticity and another for privacy. 

----------------------------------Lecture 50 Questions------------------------
1. A hash needs to be easy to compute because to reduce encryption time.

2. Weak collision resistance means given a message and its hash value, it is difficult to find another message that will hash to the same value, and Strong collision resistance means it is difficult to find any two messages that will hash to the same value.

3. Preimage resistant means it is hard to figure out a message from a given hash value. Second preimage resistant means it is difficult to find a message that hashes to the same value of a known message and its value.

4. You will find two values that hash to the same hash value after evaluating about 1.25sqrt(2^128) arguments.

5. You will find two messages that hash to the same value after evaluating about 1.25sqrt(2^160) arguments.

6. Because using cryptographic hash functions are for storing and sending data.

7. Preimage resistance.

8. Confidenctiality can be acheived by sending the message with A's public key and integrity can be acheived my sending the hash value of the message instead of the message itself, as long as A knows the hash function.

----------------------------------Lecture 51 Questions------------------------
1.No, because anyone might have R's public key and can strip off the first layer of encryption, then resend the message with their own encryption making it look like it came from them.

2. No, again the private key on the outside can be stripped off by anyone who has S's public key.

3. No, Ks inverse would have to be applies again.

4. Confidentiality and Authenticity so than you know who sent you a message and that it was securely sent.
 
----------------------------------Lecture 52 Questions------------------------
1. Nothing, the eavesdropper could still not figure out b which would be needed to figure out the message.

2. If a were discovered all the eavesdropper needs to do is intercept g, p, and (g^b)mod(p) which are being sent over the channel and be able to derive the secret message.

3. The same as the previous scenario except the eavesdropper needs to intercempt (g^a)mod(p) and will be able to figure out the message.
