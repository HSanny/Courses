Lecture 34
1. Why is it impossible to transmit a signal over a channel at an average rate
greater than C/h?

Redundancy.

2. What are reasons why computing the entropy of a natural language is difficult?

Redundancy and rules outside the bounds of probability.

3. Explain the difference between zero, first, second and third-order models.

They calculate the likelihood of a letter occurring one after the other. The high-order models will be more efficient.

Lecture 36

Because current probabilities encompass prior ones.

2. Why is the information content of a message relative to the state of knowledge
of an observer?

The observer has the probability knowledge.

Redundancy affects the probability of an object, thus affecting entropy.

Lecture 39
1. Explain why an encryption algorithm, while breakable, may not be feasible
to break?

If it is strong and simply requires brute force to break.

2. Why, given a small number of plaintext/ciphertext pairs encrypted under
key K, can K be recovered by exhausteive search in an expected time on the
order of 2n−1 operations?

Because all possibilities can be tried to decrypt it.

3. Explain why substution and transposition are both important in ciphers.

They hide the message.

4. Explain the difference between confusion and diffusion.

While confusion is about replacing letters with symbols, diffusion is about spreading out the letters to be unreadable.

5. Is confusion or diffusion better for encryption?

It depends on the method of cracking the code.

Lecture 41
1. Why are there 17576 possible decryptions for the “xyy” encoding on slide
3?

Assuming it could be poly, it’s 26 possibilities each space, thus 26^3

2. Why is the search space for question 2 on slide 3 reduced by a factor of 27?

A whole 26 is out plus one from the second space being 25.

3. Do you think a perfect cipher is possible? Why or why not?

No, because then it would not be decodable for the sender.

Lecture 42
1. Explain why the one-time pad offers perfect encryption.

There is no reduction space possible and it is random.

2. Why is it important that the key in a one-time pad be random?

So that not even the sender knows it.

3. Explain the key distribution problem.

Don’t have a secure channel to send key.

Lecture 43
1. What is a downside to using encryption by transposition?

One can match up the use of a letter in the cryptext with the regular use of it to verify that it’s a trans cipher.

Lecture 44
1. Is a one-time pad a symmetric or asymmetric algorithm?

Symmetric.

2. Describe the difference between key distribution and key management.

Distribution is who has is. Management is who can see it.

3. If someone gets a hold of Ks, can he or she decrypt S’s encrypted messages?
Why or why not?

If it is symmetric, yes because it only uses one key for encryption and decryption.

4. Are symmetric encryption systems or public key systems better?

Depends on what you have to use.

Lecture 45
1. Why do you suppose most modern symmetric encryption algorithms are
block ciphers?

They can handle it without error and it has more diffusion.

It changes the integrity in the message in an unnoticeable way.

3. What is the significance of homomorphic encryption?

It’s fast.

Lecture 46
1. Which of the 4 steps in AES uses confusion and how is it done?

SubBytes, it replaces bytes.

2. Which of the 4 steps in AES uses diffusion and how is it done?

ShiftRows, it shifts the rows by its row number

3. Why does decryption in AES take longer than encryption?

Decryption has to use division at the matrix step.

4. Describe the use of blocks and rounds in AES

The rounds seperate this into steps that can be reversed, and the blocks make it even more cryptic.
.
5. Why would one want to increase the total number of Rounds in AES?

To make it more cryptic.

Lecture 47
1. What is a disadvantage in using ECB mode?

It looks the same and patterns can be recognized.

2. How can this flaw be fixed?

Randomizing each block before encryption.

3. What are potential weaknesses of CBC?

That an attacker can spot where first changes occur and content leak can happen.

4. How is key stream generation different from standard block encryption
modes?

It encrypts the key as well.

Lecture 48
1. For public key systems, what must be kept secret in order to ensure secrecy?

The non-public key.

Only n keys need to be distributed rather thab n(n-1).

There is no way to find them mathematically.

5. Why can’t A be sure {M}Ka came from B?

It can’t look back through the encryption.

6. Why is A sure {M}K−1
b
originated with B?

It can’t read the encryption, thus it is the public one.

b
read the message?

With the public key.

message to A?

By having the key.

By also implementing a BLP structure.

Lecture 51

R
? Why or why not?

Yes, because integrity is not breached.

2. In the third attempt at key exchange on slide 5, could S have done the encryptions
in the other order? Why or why not?

No, because it isn’t cryptic enough.
