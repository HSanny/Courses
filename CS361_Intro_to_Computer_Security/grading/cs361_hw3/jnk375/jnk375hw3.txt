CS361 Questions: Week 3
The questionsmarked with a dagger (†) require external research and may be more
extensive and time consuming. You don’t have to do them for the assignment but,
but do them to increase your competency in the class.

Lecture 34
1. Why is it impossible to transmit a signal over a channel at an average rate
greater than C/h?

	- By the theorem e can be arbitrarily small but cannot increase the rate of transfer over the channel.

2. How can increasing the redundancy of the coding scheme increase the reliability
of transmitting a message over a noisy channel?

	- By repeating the code, even if some parts of the message are lost, they can be recovered later.

Lecture 35
1. If we want to transmit a sequence of the digits 0-9. According to the zeroorder
model, what is the entropy of the language?

	- h = -(log(1/10))

2. What are reasons why computing the entropy of a natural language is difficult?

	- It's hard to determine the probabilities of each letter.
	- Other letters occur more often if one or two letters appeared before it (digrams/trigrams)

3. Explain the difference between zero, first, second and third-order models.

	- Each one describes a more complex model to describe the language.
	- zero model describes an equally likely symbol language
	- first model describes the probabilities
	- second model digrams
	- third model trigrams etc...

Lecture 36
1. Why are prior probabilities sometimes impossible to compute?

	- Because the probabilities could be different depending on the situation.

2. Why is the information content of a message relative to the state of knowledge
of an observer?

	- The knowledge of an observer can affect the probability of a symbol from occurring.

3. Explain the relationship between entropy and redundancy.

	- Entropy is the lowest bound of bits to represent a message.
	- If the information stored on the message is the same length as the length of the encoded message, there is therefore no redundancy.

Lecture 37
1. List your observations along with their relevance to cryptography about
Captain Kidd’s encrypted message.

	- A lot of repeated symbols, which means high redundancy. This could lead to easier decryption by trying to observe patterns.

2. Explain why a key may be optional for the processes of encryption or decryption.

	- They could use different mehods of encryption/decryption that doesn't involve keys.

3. What effect does encrypting a file have on its information content?

	- To obscure the information context so that it's message is not clear initially.

4. How can redundancy in the source give clues to the decoding process?

	- By repeating symbols, the person decrypting the message could discern patterns that could help identify the message.

Lecture 38
1. Rewrite the following in its simplest form: D(E(D(E(P)))).

	- P

2. Rewrite the following in its simplest form: D(E((P,KE),KE),KD)

	- P

3. Why might a cryptanalyst want to recognize patterns in encrypted messages?

	- By recognizing patterns, the cryptanalyst can try to discern the meanings of the symbols and what they mean.

4. How might properties of language be of use to a cryptanalyst?

	- Certain properties of a language can be an advantage to a cryptanalyst. Properties such as redundancy for example.

Lecture 39
1. Explain why an encryption algorithm, while breakable, may not be feasible to break?

	- It could take an extremely long amount of time to break which could be crucial in time-sensitive situations.

2. Why, given a small number of plaintext/ciphertext pairs encrypted under
key K, can K be recovered by exhausteive search in an expected time on the
order of 2n-1 operations?

	- Because the encryption is under pairs, an examination of the pairs can eventually reveal the proper key.

3. Explain why substution and transposition are both important in ciphers.

	- They are both important methods of obscuring the information content in a message.

4. Explain the difference between confusion and diffusion.

	- Confusion tries to transform the plaintext into an encoded message.
	- Diffusion tries to divide the plain text over the encrypted message.

5. Is confusion or diffusion better for encryption?

	- Each have their own advantages.

Lecture 40
1. What is the difference between monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic substitution?

	- monalphabetic uniformly substitutes the symbols of a language.
	- polyalphabetic substitutes the symbols dynamically 

2. What is the key in a simple substitution cipher?

	- the alphabet

3. Why are there k! mappings from plaintext to ciphertext alphabets in simple
substitution?

	- After you figure out the mapping of 1 symbol, each subsequent symbol will take one less mapping discern.

4. What is the key in the Caesar Cipher example?

	- the alphabet

5. What is the size of the keyspace in the Caesar Cipher example?

	- 26

6. Is the Caesar Cipher algorithm strong?

	- Doesn't seem so

7. What is the corresponding decryption algorithm to the Vigenere ciphertext
example?

	- Using the Vignere table

Lecture 41
1. Why are there 17576 possible decryptions for the “xyy” encoding on slide
3?

	- 26 letters, each symbol in the message can be 26. 26 * 26 * 26

2. Why is the search space for question 2 on slide 3 reduced by a factor of 27?

	- It's reduced because there are 2 y symbols. Simple substitution is 1-1 mapping so after you figure out one y symbol you get the other.

3. Do you think a perfect cipher is possible? Why or why not?

	- I think so. It would require ambiguous translations.

Lecture 42
1. Explain why the one-time pad offers perfect encryption.

	- It offers perfect encryption because the every possible plaintext could be the pre-image of that cyphertext under a plausible key.
	- Ambiguous translation where it could be more than 1

2. Why is it important that the key in a one-time pad berandom?

	- If the key itself isn't random then the attacker and generate the ciphertext/plaintext from the key.

3. Explain the key distribution problem.

	- How would the sender give the correct key to the receiver without a secure channel. If they had a secure channel why would there be a need to send encoded messages.

Lecture 43
1. What is a downside to using encryption by transposition?

	- The symbols are not changed so the entire language symbol set is present in the encryption.

Lecture 44
1. Is a one-time pad a symmetric or asymmetric algorithm?

	- symmetric

2. Describe the difference between key distribution and key management.

	- Distribution refers to the act of transferring the keys from the sender to the receivers.
	- Key management refers to keeping the keys secure and the availability of the keys themselves when requested.

3. If someone gets a hold of Ks, can he or she decrypt S’s encrypted messages?
Why or why not?

	- Not in asymmetric encryption. There are different keys for encryption/decryption.

4. Are symmetric encryption systems or public key systems better?

	- Each have their own advantages.

Lecture 45
1. Why do you suppose most modern symmetric encryption algorithms are
block ciphers?

	- Faster

2. What is the significance of malleability?

	- Could increase encryption capabilities

3. What is the significance of homomorphic encryption?

	- It is an example of malleability and can increase encryption of a message by adding another layer of decoding.

Lecture 46
1. Which of the 4 steps in AES uses confusion and how is it done?

	- subBytes. The replacement of bytes by specific values.

2. Which of the 4 steps in AES uses diffusion and how is it done?

	- shiftRows. Shifts rows by a specific number of bytes.

3. Why does decryption in AES take longer than encryption?

	- It requires the use of a specific fixed array and multiplication of all the elements to decrypt.

4. Describe the use of blocks and rounds in AES.

	- Blocks allow input to be taken at a relatively fast rate.
	- Each round goes through the four steps of AES encryption.

5. Why would one want to increase the total number of Rounds in AES?

	- The more rounds means the longer it'll take to decrypt.

Lecture 47
1. What is a disadvantage in using ECB mode?

	- Not much obscurity, identical blocks in the plaintext yield identical blocks in the ciphertext.

2. How can this flaw be fixed?

	- Try to randomize the blocks.

3. What are potential weaknesses of CBC?

	- If an attacker is able to figure out the pattern of the changes in ECB mode or observe patterns from two identical ciphertexts, the data is compromised.


4. How is key stream generation different from standard block encryption
modes?

	- They can be randomly generated.

Lecture 48
1. For public key systems, what must be kept secret in order to ensure secrecy?

	- the correct inverse of the function

2. Why are one-way functions critical to public key systems?

	- There are many inverse relations to a one-way function used for encryption

3. How do public key systems largely solve the key distribution problem?

	- The public key functions can be distributed but the additional information needed to decode the function are private.

4. Simplify the following according to RSA rules: {{{P}K-1}K}K-1.

	- {P}K-1

5. Compare the efficiency of asymmetric algorithms and symmetric algorithms.

	- Public key encryption is much more secure but could sacrifice performance.

Lecture 49
1. If one generated new RSA keys and switched the public and private keys,
would the algorithm still work? Why or why not?

	- Yes. RSA is symmetric in the use of keys so switching the keys would still yield the correct plaintext/ciphertext.

2. Explain the role of prime numbers in RSA.

	- Prime numbers are a good way to encrypt because a large number can be factored in many ways. 

3. Is RSA breakable?

	Yes but could take a long time.

4. Why can no one intercepting {M}Ka read the message?

	- They don't have the inverse to be able to decrypt the message.

5. Why can’t A be sure {M}Ka came from B?

	- There is no authentication involved.

6. Why is A sure {M}K-1
b
originated with B?

	- A decrypts it using Kb and determines the message.

7. How can someone intercepting {M}K-1
b
read the message?

	- They have the inverse so they can decrypt the message.

8. How can B ensure authentication as well as confidentiality when sending a
message to A?

	- The use of two pairs of keys, one ensuring privacy of the message and the other pair for authentication.

Lecture 50
1. Why is it necessary for a hash function to be easy to compute for any given
data?

	- Supposed to convert into smaller chunks of data. If it is not easy it will take a long time to convert a long message.

2. What is the key difference between strong and weak collision resistance of
a hash function.

	- weak collision resistance allows one message of input to be recognized in a function, while strong collision resistance makes it hard to determine both messages using a function.

3. What is the difference between preimage resistance and second preimage
resistance?

	- preimage reistance applies the function to only the message whereas second preimage resistance applies the function to both arguments.

4. What are the implications of the birthday attack on a 128 bit hash value?

	- An attack would need on average 2^127 encryptions.

5. What are the implications of the birthday attack on a 160 bit hash value?

	- An attack would need on average 2^160 encryptions.

6. Why aren’t cryptographic hash functions used for confidentiality?

	- cryptographic hash functions provide no extra information on the properties of confidentiality related to reading of information.
	- They are used for integrity because they indicate any writes to the information.

7. What attribute of cryptographic hash functions ensures that message M is
bound to H(M), and therefore tamper-resistant?

	- The hash is recomputed after each use or access.

8. Using RSA and a cryptographic hash function, how can B securely send a
message to A and guarantee both confidentiality and integrity?

	- RSA to protect confidentiality
	- A cryptographic hash function to uphold integrity.

Lecture 51
1. For key exchange, if S wants to send key K to R, can S send the following
message: {{K}KS-1}K-1
R
? Why or why not?

	- No because the key K would need the key K and the key S to be able to get the key.

2. In the third attempt at key exchange on slide 5, could S have done the encryptions
in the other order? Why or why not?

	- No. R could not decrypt S's message.

3. Is {{{K}KS-1}KR}KS equivalent to {{K}K-1
S
}KR?

	- No.

4. What are the requirements of key exchange and why?

	- Confidentiality of the key and authentication of the sender.

CS361 Questions: Week 3 6
Lecture 52
1. What would happen if g, p and gamodp were known by an eavesdropper
listening in on a Diffie-Hellman exchange?

	- Doesn't matter, they would still need other variables.

2. What would happen if a were discovered by an eavesdropper listening in on
a Diffie-Hellman exchange?

	- Security is compromised, the attacker just needs either a or b to be able to decrypt.

3. What would happen if b were discovered by an eavesdropper listening in on
a Diffie-Hellman exchange?

	-Same thing, security is compromised, the attacker just needs either a or b to be able to decrypt.
