Lecture 34
1)
  it is impossible to send at a greater rate than C/h because that would
  mean that someone found an encoding better than the entropy which
  goes against the definition of the entropy of the language.

2)
  Increases redundancy in encoding increases the likely hood that the
  entire message is able to get across despite noise in the channel.
  This can be likend to a person repeating themselves in a room 
  with a lot of people.

Lecture 35
1)
  log(1/9)
  
2)
  It is difficult because natural languages contain a lot of redundancy
  in its' transmission. This increases the number of orders a person
  has to go through in order to get closer to the actual entropy.

3)
  The zero order model assumes all symbols are equally likely to appear.
  The first order model takes into accound that not all sysmbols appear
  with the same amount of likelyhood. The second order model introduces 
  the idea that every symbol has some likelyhood of another symbol
  following it while the third order works upon the second order and 
  computes likelyhoods with three symbols.

Lecture 36
1)
  They can be impossible to compute because you don't always know how much
  information the reciever will already have.

2)
  The content is relative because depending upon how much a reciever knows
  it may require more or less information to get across the message.

3)
  Entropy is a measure of the minimum encoding needed to send a message
  clearly across a noiseless channel. Redundancy is what is created when
  an encoding is not at the optimal or entropy measured level.

Lecture 37
1)
  The original language of the message is probably english because of a pun
  that only works in the English language. This means we can utilize what
  we know about letter usage in the language. The complexity of the
  encryption is probably just a simple substitution cypher because it was
  encrypted by a pirate on a ship so there is a chance we can decrypt it.

2)
  A key may be optional because potentially all you need in order to 
  decrypt or encrypt a message is just an algorithm for how it was
  done without needing some sort of other input.

3)
  Encryption essentially creates a systematically noisy channel which makes
  it difficult to read a message in plain text.

4)
  Redundancy in the soucrce can allow a decrypter to leverage the positions
  of the redundancys to make sense of what other letters could be likely
  in smaller words.

Lecture 38
1)
  D(E(D(E(P)))) = P

2)
  D(E(E(P,Ke),Ke),Kd) = E(P,Ke)

3)
  Patterns help a cryptanalst uncover how an encryption algorithm
  works an allows them to develop rules for decryption

4)
  Properties of a language allow a cryptanalst to apply percentages of
  plain text symbols and compare it to percentage of encrypted symbols.

Lecture 39
1)
  It can potentially not be feasible to break because mathimatically the
  amount of keys to an encryption could take thousands of years to figure
  out even with a computer working onit.

2)
  On average you find the key you are looking for tends to be halfway 
  through the total number of keys. This means that for every extra bit in
  a key you add twice as many new combination as before.

3)
  They are both important because they are the building block for more 
  complicated encryption algorithms that do them over and over in many
  different ways and combinations.

4)
  Confusion just changes how information looks so it cannot be read right
  away while diffusion doesn't change how it looks it just moves it around.

5)
  Neither is better than the other they are both just as important and 
  useful and are used together all the time.

Lecture 40
1)
  A polyaphabetic subsittution  uses a crossreference between a key and two alphabets 
  while a momaphabetic only map to a single alphabet.

2)
  The key is the number of positions you shift over in an alphabet.

3)
  This is because for every letter the are k -n possibilities.

4)
  The key in a ceasar cypher is the number of positions you shift over.

5)
  26!

6)
  It is not very strong because there are only 26! ways to map to letters
  which is not a lot for a computer to compute.

7)
  The decryption algorithms is the reverse of the encryption algorithm.

Lecture 41
1)
  This is because each letter can be any of the 26 letters of an aphabet.

2)
  This is done becuase it is determined that it is a simple substitution which
  means there are only 26x25 total encryptions instead of 26x26.

3)
  No I do not think a perfect cypher is a possibility. I think that the most
  that is possible is extending the amount of time to crack a cypher.

Lecture 42
1)
  It offers perfect encryption because any cypher text could be the mirror
  of a plain text so there is no way to break down the number of possibilities.

2)
  It is important because if it isn't a person could break work backwards 
  to eliminate some plaintext.

3)
  The problem is that both the reciever and the sender have to have the key.
  The only want to send it to them is over a secure channel. If there is 
  already a secure channel than there is no reason to have a key to begin with.

Lecture 43
1)
  The downside would be that letter frequency is preserved no matter what.

Lecture 44
1)
  One-time pad is a symetric algorithm.

2)
  Key distribution deals with getting the necessary decryption key to another person.
  Key managment has to do with controling the total number of keys in a system per
  extra user.

3)
  No becuase in an asymetric system K's key would already be available for 
  anyone to send a message to S not decrypt the message.

4)
  Neither are better than the other. They both have obstacles to get across
  but an implementation of asymetric would be easier.

Lecture 45
1)
  I believe it is because a lot of modern cyphers use transpositions in their
  cyphers and they are immune to tampering and are not malleable.

2)
  Malleability is important becuase you don't want a third party to be able
  to edit cypher text and have a predictable outcome on the plain text to
  use that as a way to edit the plaintext message.

3)
  Homomorphic encryption allows people to create secure voting systems
  as well as collision-resistant hash functions.

Lecture 46
1)
  The third step uses confusion by multiplying the state by a fixed 4x4 matrix.

2)
  The second step accomplishes diffusion by a simple row transposition.

4)
  Decryption takes longer because you have to multilpy by an inverse array
  and this inverse array involes more costly multiplication than the 
  encryption.

5)
  If you increased the total number of rounds you increase the amount
  that the data is moved around and changed.

Lecture 47
1)
  The disadvantage is that identical blocks in the plain text produce 
  identical blocks in the cypher text.

2)
  It can be fixed by randomizing the plaintext block before they are
  encrypted.

3)
  A potential weakness is found by looking for when two encryptions change
  or differ.

4)
  The output looks and appears random but it is reproducible in key stream
  as compared to block.

Lecture 48
1)
  The one way function used for creating the encryption needs to be kept 
  secret.

2)
  They are critical because it allows for the public key to be available to
  everyone so they can send a secure message but not allow a third party
  to decrypt it.

3)
  They largely solve the issue of key distribution because public 
  key encryption does not care who has the public key because only the
  private key can easily undo the encryption.

4) {{{P}k-1}k}k-1 = {p}k-1

5)
  Symetric algorithms are faster because they utilize operations that are easy 
  to efficiently perform on a processor while asymetric algorithms are 
  10000 times slower because of the complex operations needed to encrypt and
  decrypt.

Lecture 49
1)
  Yes it would still work if you switched the keys because the only thing that 
  matters that one is consistently used as a private and the other used as 
  a public key.

2)
  Multiplying two large prime numbers returns a number which is difficult to
  factor unless the two numbers are known. 

3)
  It is breakable but it is not feasable to do so because it could take a very long
  time to figure it out.

4)
  They cannot read the message because A is the only one with the private key
  that is able to decrypt the message.

5)
  A can't be sure because the public key could come from any person not just B.

6)
  A is sure because B is the only one who could send the message with the particular
  private key.

7)
  They can read the message because it is possible to decrypt it with the public key
  that B made available to everyone.

8)
  B can ensure both authentication as well as confidentiality by using two pairs of 
  keys where one is meant to send a message confidentially and the other signs it
  so that another user can verify who it came from.

Lecture 50
1)
  It has to be easy to compute so that an arbitrarily large amount of data can
  be hashed to a single integer.

2)
  The difference between weak and strong collision resistance is that weak collision
  resistance means that in weak collision resistance two equal messages hash to the same
  value and is strong in the case that it is hard to find messages that are equal but
  hash to the same value.

3)
  Preimage resistance means that givent the hash value it is hard to find a message that hashes to it
  while second preimage it is hard to find two different messages that hash to the same value.

4)
  You only have to look at 1.25sqrt(128) values on average to find a collision.

5)
  You only have to look at 1.25sqrt(160) values on average to find a collision.

6)
  They are not used for confidentiality because they do not store any of the 
  information they compute a value that it gets from the total information 
  and turns it into an integer.

7)
  Resistance to collisions ensures that if you tamper with data you are more than
  likey going to get a different hash value before the tampering.

8)
  B can send a message to A using Ka and send A a hash value for the message that he intended.
  A can then computer the hash value and if they do not match then the message has been tampered with.

Lecture 51
1)
  No S cannot because both levels of encryption are able to be decrypted through the 
  use of publically available keys.

2)
  No S could not have sent them in a reverse order because then confidentiality 
  would be compromised since the entire message would not be able to only be
  decrypted by R. It could work but it is not as secure. 

3)
  No they are not equivalent because one message can only be decrypted by R and the other needs
  to be decrypted by both R and S  to get to the actual message.

4)
  It requires two levels or encryption to be used in order to maintain both
  confidentiality and authentication.

Lecture 52
1)
  The eavesdropper would not be able to compute the value that is intended
  because it does not have the secret value that b has chosen and kept to itself.

2&3)
  If the eaves dropper discovered either a or b then they would be able to compute
  the value that was intended in the message.
