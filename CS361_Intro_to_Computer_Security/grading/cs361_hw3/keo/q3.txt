The questions marked with a dagger (†) require external research and may be more
extensive and time consuming. You don’t have to do them for the assignment but,

Lecture 34
1. Why is it impossible to transmit a signal over a channel at an average rate
greater than C/h?
-Because that would require an encoding that is more efficient than the entropy of the language which is impossible.
2. How can increasing the redundancy of the coding scheme increase the reli-
ability of transmitting a message over a noisy channel?
-It allows the transmission data no matter how much noise.


Lecture 35
1. If we want to transmit a sequence of the digits 0-9. According to the zero-
order model, what is the entropy of the language?
-h = -(.1 * log .1 )
2. What are reasons why computing the entropy of a natural language is diffi-
cult?
-No one knows the exact probabilities for each unit.
3. Explain the difference between zero, first, second and third-order models.
- zero order model assumes equal probabilities for each symbol,
first order uses the independent probability of each symbol
second order uses digrams(2 symbol combos) to calculate probabilities
thrid order uses trigrams.

Lecture 36
1. Why are prior probabilities sometimes impossible to compute?
-It would require clairvoyance
2. Why is the information content of a message relative to the state of knowl-
edge of an observer?
-If they observer has more information, then the encoding can be more efficient.
3. Explain the relationship between entropy and redundancy.
-Redundancy is directedly correlated to how far the encoding efficeincy is from the entropy

Lecture 37
1. List your observations along with their relevance to cryptography about
Captain Kidd’s encrypted message.
-There are 19 different characters, each character has over 4 bits of information
2. Explain why a key may be optional for the processes of encryption or de-
cryption.

sages?
-to break the code
4. How might properties of language be of use to a cryptanalyst?
-patterns could be matched to the cipher text that would help solve the encryption algorithm

Lecture 39
1. Explain why an encryption algorithm, while breakable, may not be feasible
to break?
-The process could take thousands or millions of years.
2. Why, given a small number of plaintext/ciphertext pairs encrypted under
key K, can K be recovered by exhausteive search in an expected time on the
order of 2 n−1 operations?
-because every combination must be tried to find the key so on average it is 2^(n-1)
3. Explain why substution and transposition are both important in ciphers.
-All ciphers just use a combination of substitution and transposition.
4. Explain the difference between confusion and diffusion.
-confusion replaces symbols in the plaintext , diffusion moves information to different places
5. Is confusion or diffusion better for encryption?
-Confusion is better.

Lecture 40
1. What is the difference between monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic substitution?

2. What is the key in a simple substitution cipher?
- a table(mapping)

substitution?

5. What is the size of the keyspace in the Caesar Cipher example?
-26
6. Is the Caesar Cipher algorithm strong?
- Nay
7. What is the corresponding decryption algorithm to the Vigenere ciphertext example?
-for each letter in the key text, find the corresponding ciphertext symbol and use that column letter.

Lecture 41
1. Why are there 17576 possible decryptions for the “xyy” encoding on slide 3?
-each letter could be any letter in the plaintext
2. Why is the search space for question 2 on slide 3 reduced by a factor of 27?
-because both y's are the same letter
3. Do you think a perfect cipher is possible? Why or why not?
-Yes, the one-time pad.

Lecture 42
1. Explain why the one-time pad offers perfect encryption.
-no possiblities can be removed even knowing the algo and ciphertext
2. Why is it important that the key in a one-time pad be random?
-nothing can be known about the key

Lecture 44
1. Is a one-time pad a symmetric or asymmetric algorithm?
