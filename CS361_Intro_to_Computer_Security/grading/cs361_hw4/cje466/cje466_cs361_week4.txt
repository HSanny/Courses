Why is it important for a digital signature to be non reusable?  -> Digital signatures function much as physical signatures.  Ideally a signature should be: unforgeable, authentic,  tamperproof, non-reusable, and allow no repudiation.2. Why is it the hash of the message typically signed, rather than the message itself?  -> In the case of an alleged forgery, a third party may be called  to judge authenticity.3. What assurance does R gain from the interchange on slide 4?  ->So, if S wishes to send message M to R in a way that has some of  the characteristics of a digitally signed message, S could send***************************************Lecture 54***************************************1. What is the importance of certificate authorities?  -> A certificate is constructed with digital signatures and hash functions.  A public key and a user’s identity are bound together within a  certificate, signed by a certification authority, vouching for the  accuracy of the binding.2. In the example on slide 5, why does X sign the hash of the first message  with its private key?  -> Yes, x signed it with it's private key.3. Why is it necessary to have a hash of Y and Ky?  -> Certificates are needed to establish a web of trust in a  distributed environment.4. What would happen if Z had a public key for X, but it was not trustworthy?  -> It won't be able to open the message unless it was signed with x's private key.***************************************Lecture 55***************************************1. What happens at the root of a chain of trust?  -> Ideally, the chain is rooted at some unimpeachable authority.2. Why does an X.509 certificate include a “validity interval”?  ->  1 Version: version of X.509 used;  2 Serial number: unique among certificates issued by this issuer;  3 Signature algorithm identifier: identifies the algorithm and params used to sign the certificate;  4 Issuer’s distinguished name: with serial number, makes allcertificates unique;  5 Validity interval: start and end times for validity;  6 Subject’s distinguished name: identifies the party being“vouched for”;  7 Subject’s public key info: identifies algorithm, params, and public key;3. What would it mean if the hash and the received value did not match?  -> That is not a trusted connection.***************************************Lecture 56***************************************1. What are some protocols previously discussed?  -> One time pad protocols and EAS protocols2. What may happen if one step of a protocol is ignored?  -> The message can be compromaise along with the key3. Why must the ciphers commute in order to accomplish the task in slide 4?  -> So it can be taken out after the protocol applies more then one4. Describe how an attacker can extract M from the protocol in slide 6.  ->To cancel it out just XOR with the same values.5. Describle how an attacker can extract Ka from the protocol in slide 6.  -> The attacker can XOR again with Kb leaving only M XOR Ka then XOR with Ka and retrieeve  the message XOR with message then XOR to retrieve Ka.6. Describle how an attacker can extract Kb from the protocol in slide 6.  ->XOR again with M will give B after 3d step7. Why are cryptographic protocols difficult to design and easy to get wrong?  -> Because the longer the process the more opportunity for the proccess to be    flawed.***************************************Lecture 57***************************************1. Explain the importance of protocols in the context of the internet.  -> Protocols is the medium through which we are allowed to retrieve information    in the correct order and be able to interpret the messages between two or more    entities. The server uses some type of protocol to understand and respond to    request that users make.2. Explain the importance of cryptographic protocols in the context of the internet.  -> The cryptographic protocols is very vital to the internet because otherwise  information will be out for everyone to be able to acces. An example of this is  emails, they use the cryptographic protocol to ensure users that those messages  are not being intercepted and fill with mallicious data.3. What are the assumptions of the protocol in slide 6?  -> That both A and B know each others private key4. What are the goals of the protocol in slide 6?  -> To be able to use the key securely to talk to each other.5. Are the goals of the protocol in slide 6 satisfied? Explain.  -> No since A and B's transmission of the message is flawed. The transmition    of messages between them is compromised.6. How is the protocol in slide 6 flawed?  -> Because the key needed to decrypt the message are given on the message.***************************************Lecture 58***************************************1. Why is it important to know if a protocol includes unnecessary steps or  messages?  -> A standard set of questions can be asked of any cryptographic  protocol. To understand the bulnerabilities of our system.2. Why is it important to know if a protocol encrypts items that could be sentin the clear?  -> We want to look at protocols abstractly and ignore issues at  the implementation level.***************************************Lecture 59***************************************1. Why might it be difficult to answer what constitutes an attack on a cryptographic  protocol?  ->One of the hardest things about analyzing a protocol is understanding     what an attacker might do. The rages of possibilities for an attacker    is far to large to be able to find all possibilities.2. Describe potential dangers of a replay attack.  -> Replay: attacker records messages and replays them at a later time    causing confusion and /or distortion.3. Are there attacks where an attacker gains no secret information? Explain.  -> Yes, an example of this is Interleaving attack: attacker injects spurious  messages into a protocol run to disrupt or subvert it.4. What restrictions are imposed on the attacker?  -> The attacker cannot generate an arbitrary message since keys are  usualy required when sending messages.5. Why is it important that protocols are asynchronous?  -> Because a party might not know that they are part of a current communication  until they receive their first message and in order to responde the message must be  identifiable. In other words have some sort of credability.***************************************Lecture 60***************************************1. Would the Needham-Schroeder protocol work without nonces?  -> No because the protocol assumes that both parties have secure symetric communication  with S by using the key. This way it prevents from replay attacks by generating a shared key.2. For each step of the NS protocol, answer the two questions on slide 5.  ->    --What is the sender trying to say with this message?      -The sender is trying to cimmunicate with S so that S may generate a key for it's messages being send and received.        It build some type of trust between the parties.    --What is the receiver entitled to believe after receiving the message?      - The receiver can send back messages if it know that the key was just generated. If there is communication        the receiver is allot to assume that its ok to stablish communication.***************************************Lecture 61***************************************1. As in slide 5, if A’s key were later changed, after having Kas compromised,  how could A still be impersonated?  -> Denning and Sacco pointed out that the compromise of a session  key has bad consequences. An intruder can reuse an old session  key and pass it off as a new one as though it were fresh.  Bauer, et al. pointed out that if key Kas were compromised,  anyone could impersonate A and establish communication with any  other party.2. Is it fair to ask the question of a key being broken?  -> No because if the key is comprimise the inpersonation can occured    however it's difficult to know if the key has been compromised or not.3. How might you address these flaws if you were the protocol designer?  -> Maybe have a system that requires you to acquire a key for evey 30 minutes  the it becomes un active.***************************************Lecture 62***************************************1. What guarantees does Otway-Rees seem to provide to A and B?  -> A will inform B when it's sending a message to B so that B can then send to the  key server for authentication of both A and B.2. Are there guarantees that Needham-Schroeder provides that Otway-Rees  does not or vice versa?  ->The ability to authenticate a the validity of a message before it's receive prevents it  from mallicious attackers.3. How could you fix the flawed protocol from slide 4?  -> Just add a key server to that the sender can be authenticated and reduces the risk  of having another party trying to inpersonate the sender.***************************************Lecture 63***************************************1. Why is the verification of protocols important?  -> Protocols are crucial to the Internet; it would be great to get them right.    Reasoning rigorously about protocols requires some way of formalizing their    behavior and properties. Belief logics is such an approach.2. What is a belief logic?  -> Belief logics allow reasoning about what principals within the  protocol should be able to infer from the messages they see.  Allows abstract proofs, but may miss some important flaws.3. A protocol is a program; where do you think beliefs come in?  ->State exploration methods (model checking) treat a protocol    as a finite state system and conduct an exhaustive search    checking that all reachable states are safe.***************************************Lecture 64***************************************1. What is a modal logic?  -> Is a type pf formal logic that extends the propositional and the    predicate.2. Explain the intuition behind the message meaning inference rule.  -> If A believes (A share(K) B) and A sees {X}K then A believes(B said X).3. Explain the intuition behind the nonce verification inference rule.  -> If A believes that a message is fresh and A believe that the message came from B, then A believes that B believes X.4. Explain the intuition behind the jurisdiction inference rule.  -> If A believes that B has jurisdiction over C and A believes that B believes X  then A believes X.5. What is idealization and why is it needed?  -> Idealization of the protocol is not defined unambiguously. It  depends on the interpretation of the meaning of some steps.***************************************Lecture 65***************************************1. Why do you think plaintext is omitted in a BAN idealization?  -> Because plain text can be easily forgoten.2. Some idealized steps seem to refer to beliefs that will happen later in the  protocol. Why would that be?  -> Because some of the messages need to have some type of validation before they can  be believed or referenced.3. One benefit of a BAN proof is that it exposes assumptions. Explain that.  -> It exposes assumptions by deriving the beliefs that make up a protocol and only the assumptions that    hold true are used.  NOTE: Some of the questions are straight from the class lecture notes
