Questions Week 4

--------------------------------Lecture 53 Questions---------------------------------
1. So that it cannot be pulled off and used on another message.

2. Because the message still needs to arrive confidentially.

3. That the message came from S.

--------------------------------Lecture 54 Questions---------------------------------
1. They assure us of the binding between a public key and the identity it represents.

2. That way Y will know the message is from X, the certificate authority.

3. The hash binds the identity and the public key together. If the hash is secure, it will be difficult to reproduce the hash value and forge the certificate.

4. Z has to have the public key for X to be able to check the certificate. If this question is asking if Z will try to mimic a certificate authority, if Z passes the message along to someone else, they will know the message did not come from X since the x privage key was stripped off and will know that the message is not signed by a certificate authority.

--------------------------------Lecture 55 Questions---------------------------------
1. The root of the chain has to be a trusted authority.

2. To know how long a certificate is valid for.

3. You know it is not a valid certificate. 

--------------------------------Lecture 56 Questions---------------------------------
1. We have talked about Diffie-Hellman, RSA, and AES.

2. What you are trying to protect might be compromised or unable to be recovered by the recieving end.

3. So that they can be added and removed in non-reverse order.

4. The attacker can collect all three messaged sent and XOR them to retrieve M.

5. The attacker can collect all three messaged sent and XOR them to retrieve Ka.

7. Because they need to be designed in such a way that information is secure, but available to the parties passing the information between them without hindering their access with an incorrectly implemented protocol. 

--------------------------------Lecture 57 Questions---------------------------------
1. Protocols are used in many applications online such as transfering files and sending emails.

2. Cryptographic protocols allow the protocols to be carried out securely.

3. That there is a public key structure in place, and each principal has the correct keys.

4. To allow the other party to recieve the message confidentially and with authentication, while allowing a response to inform the sending party that the message was revieced. 

5. Yes the goals are satisfied because the RSA key structure allows the message to be sent confidentially and with authenticity. 

6. The one flaw may be that the receiving party must assume that only the sending party has ownership of its private key, which it is trusting for authentication. 
 
--------------------------------Lecture 58 Questions---------------------------------
1. It can make encryption and decryption slower or provide more information to attackers about the encryption process.

2. It can provide attackers with clues as to how the encryption is done.

--------------------------------Lecture 59 Questions---------------------------------
1. Because more questions come into play about the implementation of the protocol and what weaknesses the protocol is susceptible too.

2. A replay attack can interject previous messages in the communication between two parties causing confusion.

3. Yes, attacks can be made that simply hinder the flow of information between two parties.

4. The attacker cannot send arbitrary messages which appear to be encrypted with the same key two parties are using.

5. So that when a party recieves a message, it knows what that message means and how to respond to it.

--------------------------------Lecture 60 Questions---------------------------------
1. It would not work without nonces because messages would be able to be replayed.

2. Step 1). Sender is saying I need a key between me and B, send this nonce back to me so I know this is fresh.
  	    Reciever must believe that A sent the message and they want a key.
   Step 2). Sender is saying here is the key you wanted with the person you wanted it to. Pass the included message along to the person you want the key formed with.
	    Reciever must believe the key is fresh because of the returned nonce, and must know to pass the message on to B.
   Step 3.) Sender says here is a key from me, generated by the key server so trust it.
    	    Reciever must trust it since it is encoded with the key between B and the key server, and knows it is from A
   Step 4.) Sender says here is a nonce and I am using our new key, show me you got this.
	    Reciever knows the nonce is from B because of their shared key.
   Step 5.) Sender says here is your nonce back with some function applied to it.
	    Reciever will check that new value with his nonce with the same function applied to it to authenticate A.

--------------------------------Lecture 61 Questions---------------------------------
1. Someone can still impersinate A by storing and resending the message in step 3, which does not contain a nonce.

2. No it is not since every protocol must assume that keys are strong and uncompromised for the protocol to work.

3. You could add extra authentication steps to double check keys and identities, but it would be slowing down or hindering the protocol with extra steps.

--------------------------------Lecture 62 Questions---------------------------------
1. It guarantees A and B that they have initiated the conversation directly with each other and that the interactions are fresh because they include nonces in the messages.

2. Otway Rees provides the gaurantee that one subject has initiated the protocol directly with another subject without there being an intermediary.

3. The flaw can be fixed by doubling up the inverse step so that the single cancellation is not enough to reveal the message.
--------------------------------Lecture 63 Questions---------------------------------
1. Protocol verification is important because protocols which will become widely used must be proven secure.

2. Belief logic is a mode for reasoning the security of a protocol by deciding what can and cannot be seen by a specific subject during any point of the protocol.

3. Beliefs come in when proving that the program follows the principles and goals you are trying to achieve with the program.
--------------------------------Lecture 64 Questions---------------------------------
1. A type of logic, such as belief logic, used to prove potocols.

2. It means that if one subject sends a message to another encrypted with a shared key between only them, the other subject can believe the message came from the first.

3. It means that one subject believes that it and the other subject in the conversations both believe in the freshness of a message. 

4. It means that a subject will believe a message about a specific topic if the sender is an expert in that topic.

5. Idealization is used to try and find out what a message is trying to accomplish in the recievers point of view. It is important to prove that the protocol is accomplashing its goals.

--------------------------------Lecture 65 Questions---------------------------------
1. To keep the proofs concise so other interpretations of text cannot change the meaning of the idealization.

2. Because the subjects know the steps in the protocol.

3. By reviewing what a subject is able to infer from a message and the other parties involved, a BAN proof will show what can be directly taken as truth from a message and its context rather than what was being assumed.
