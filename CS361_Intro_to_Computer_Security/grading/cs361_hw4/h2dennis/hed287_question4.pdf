Lecture 53
1. Why is it important for a digital signature to be non reusable?

So that others can’t use it to steal an identity

2. Why is it the hash of the message typically signed, rather than the message
itself?

Because public key encryption is expensive and the message may be arbitrarily long.

3. What assurance does R gain from the interchange on slide 4?

The assurances of being unforgable, authentic, non-repudable, tamperproof, and non-reusable.

Lecture 54
1. What is the importance of certificate authorities?

Provides authentication that the message is from the sender

2. In the example on slide 5, why does X sign the hash of the first message
with its private key?

Signing the message in its entirety would be expensive and time consuming. 

3. Why is it necessary to have a hash of Y and Ky?

They are both long.

4. What would happen if Z had a public key for X, but it was not trustworthy?

Z should get a new key from X.

Lecture 55
1. What happens at the root of a chain of trust?

If it is based in unimpeachable authority, it is ideal.

2. Why does an X.509 certificate include a “validity interval”?

To date when a message becomes certified.

3. What would it mean if the hash and the received value did not match?

The message is not trustworthy.

Lecture 56
1. What are some protocols previously discussed?

BLP, RSA

2. What may happen if one step of a protocol is ignored?

The message may be unreceivable.

3. Why must the ciphers commute in order to accomplish the task in slide 4?

Because the two parties don’t share a key.

4. Describe how an attacker can extract M from the protocol in slide 6.

Depending on the step, they will only need one key to find the message.

5. Describle how an attacker can extract Ka from the protocol in slide 6.

If you have the message, you can XOR it with one of the steps, you may also need Kb.

6. Describle how an attacker can extract Kb from the protocol in slide 6.

Same as before, but may also need Ka.

7. Why are cryptographic protocols difficult to design and easy to get wrong?

One needs a one time pad to do it.

Lecture 57
1. Explain the importance of protocols in the context of the internet.

Secure messages are very important on a thing that many users use.

2. Explain the importance of cryptographic protocols in the context of the internet.

It helps secure messages be secure an have authentication.

3. What are the assumptions of the protocol in slide 6?

RSA

4. What are the goals of the protocol in slide 6?

Authentication and confidentiality.

5. Are the goals of the protocol in slide 6 satisfied? Explain.

Yes, because the private key is like a signature, and it’s only unlocked by a person’s public key.

6. How is the protocol in slide 6 flawed?

Someone could have stolen that public key.

Lecture 58
1. Why is it important to know if a protocol includes unnecessary steps or
messages?

To not waste resources or give away unnecessary info.

2. Why is it important to know if a protocol encrypts items that could be sent
in the clear?

To be secure.

Lecture 59
1. Why might it be difficult to answer what constitutes an attack on a cryptographic
protocol?

The attack is cryptic itself.

2. Describe potential dangers of a replay attack.

It displays the message to the attacker.

3. Are there attacks where an attacker gains no secret information? Explain.

Only unsuccessful attacks.

4. What restrictions are imposed on the attacker?

To not decrypt the message.

5. Why is it important that protocols are asynchronous?

So that they don’t lead to more info if attacked.

Lecture 60
1. Would the Needham-Schroeder protocol work without nonces?

Yes.

2. For each step of the NS protocol, answer the two questions on slide 5.

The information will not be necessary if it is ultimately declassified.

Lecture 61
1. As in slide 5, if A’s key were later changed, after having Kas compromised,
how could A still be impersonated?

Yes.

2. Is it fair to ask the question of a key being broken?

Yes.

3. How might you address these flaws if you were the protocol designer?

Use symmetric keys.

Lecture 62
1. What guarantees does Otway-Rees seem to provide to A and B?

Some of the many from NS

2. Are there guarantees that Needham-Schroeder provides that Otway-Rees
does not or vice versa?

No.

3. How could you fix the flawed protocol from slide 4?

Use symmetric keys.

Lecture 63
1. Why is the verification of protocols important?

To be secure in authorization.

2. What is a belief logic?

A belief in logical security.

3. A protocol is a program; where do you think beliefs come in?

From how its implemented.

Lecture 64
1. What is a modal logic?

Logic based on pure intuitions.

2. Explain the intuition behind the message meaning inference rule.

The impulse to be confidential.

3. Explain the intuition behind the nonce verification inference rule.

The carrying of the load to the authorized clearance.

4. Explain the intuition behind the jurisdiction inference rule.

To justly allocate the message.

5. What is idealization and why is it needed?

To have both confidentiality and authorization.

Lecture 65
1. Why do you think plaintext is omitted in a BAN idealization?

To be more secure.

2. Some idealized steps seem to refer to beliefs that will happen later in the
protocol. Why would that be?

They could refer back to past secure channels.

3. One benefit of a BAN proof is that it exposes assumptions. Explain that.
It brings out logic, thus showing only the truth.
