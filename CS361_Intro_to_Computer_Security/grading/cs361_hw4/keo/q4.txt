CS361 Questions: Week 4

The questions marked with a dagger (†) require external research and may be more
extensive and time consuming. You don’t have to do them for the assignment but,
but do them to increase your competency in the class.

Lecture 53
1. Why is it important for a digital signature to be non reusable?
-So someone else can't use it for something else.
2. Why is it the hash of the message typically signed, rather than the message
itself?
-because it's a small constant size
3. What assurance does R gain from the interchange on slide 4?
- unforgeable, authentic, tamperproof, non-reusable

Lecture 54
1. What is the importance of certificate authorities?
-they are trusted 3rd parties that can create certificates
2. In the example on slide 5, why does X sign the hash of the first message
with its private key?
-so that he can signed a uniformly sized piece of data
3. Why is it necessary to have a hash of Y and K y ?
-so it will be hash sized.
4. What would happen if Z had a public key for X, but it was not trustworthy?
-then certificates from X wouldn't be trusted.

Lecture 55
1. What happens at the root of a chain of trust?
-it's an authority with a lot to lose  if it isn't trusted.
2. Why does an X.509 certificate include a “validity interval”?
-to keep them fresh
3. What would it mean if the hash and the received value did not match?
-the value is incorrect

Lecture 56
1. What are some protocols previously discussed?
-Needham and Schroeder, Ottoway Rees
2. What may happen if one step of a protocol is ignored?
-a participant may lose confidence in the security
3. Why must the ciphers commute in order to accomplish the task in slide 4?
-so one encryption can be unencrypted after another encryption has been applied
4. Describe how an attacker can extract M from the protocol in slide 
6.
-because 2 of the encryptions cancel out and he has the private key that he used.
-5. Describle how an attacker can extract K a from the protocol in slide 
6.
-trick A into applying XOR Ka again
6. Describle how an attacker can extract K b from the protocol in slide 
6.
-intercept message from B, use above trick to find M, then XOR M to get Kb
7. Why are cryptographic protocols difficult to design and easy to get wrong?
-difficult to forsee all possible vulnerabilities
       
Lecture 57
1. Explain the importance of protocols in the context of the internet.
-TCP IP is a protocol 
2. Explain the importance of cryptographic protocols in the context of the in-
ternet.
-allows secure/private communication
3. What are the assumptions of the protocol in slide 6?
-that Kb is actually B's public key, same for A
4. What are the goals of the protocol in slide 6?
-to share a secret key
5. Are the goals of the protocol in slide 6 satisfied? Explain.
-no, because an attacker can intercept and reply to A's satisfaction
6. How is the protocol in slide 6 flawed?
-Eve can trick B into decrypting the message

Lecture 58
1. Why is it important to know if a protocol includes unnecessary steps or
messages?
-because decryption can take a long time
2. Why is it important to know if a protocol encrypts items that could be sent
in the clear?
-to avoid more decryption time

Lecture 59
1. Why might it be difficult to answer what constitutes an attack on a crypto-
graphic protocol?
-there are so many possibilities
2. Describe potential dangers of a replay attack.
-old messages can be reset to cause confusion
3. Are there attacks where an attacker gains no secret information? Explain.
-yes, they can interfere with the communication and compromise integrity
4. What restrictions are imposed on the attacker?
-we can only know that he doesn't have the private key
5. Why is it important that protocols are asynchronous?
-because packets can be lost and must be resent

Lecture 60
1. Would the Needham-Schroeder protocol work without nonces?
-no, messages would not be guaranteed fresh
-2. For each step of the NS protocol, answer the two questions on slide 
5. a. what is the sender trying to say? b. What can the receiver believe?
i I want to talk to B. A needs a key Kab
ii I've encrypted Kab with Kbs. The message is fresh.
iii use this secret key. A shares a key with S
iv I recieved the key. We now share a key.
v I got your confirmation. A knows I have the key too.

Lecture 61
1. As in slide 5, if A’s key were later changed, after having K as compromised,
how could A still be impersonated?
- yes, S still has Kas
2. Is it fair to ask the question of a key being broken?
-yes, because all keys are breakable
3. How might you address these flaws if you were the protocol designer?
-use a one-time pad everytime

Lecture 62
1. What guarantees does Otway-Rees seem to provide to A and B?
-message from A to B is fresh
2. Are there guarantees that Needham-Schroeder provides that Otway-Rees
does not or vice versa?
-they are very similar
3. How could you fix the flawed protocol from slide 4?
-use a certification to associate the public keys

Lecture 63
1. Why is the verification of protocols important?
-to be confident that the protocol accomplishes it's goals
2. What is a belief logic?
-a logic to reason about what each person can know is true at any point in time
3. A protocol is a program; where do you think beliefs come in?
-to verify the protocols

Lecture 64
1. What is a modal logic?
-logic that includes qualifiers like necessarily, possibly, and impossibly
2. Explain the intuition behind the message meaning inference rule.
-that only B has K
3. Explain the intuition behind the nonce verification inference rule.
-B wouldn't send a fresh message if it didn't believe it
4. Explain the intuition behind the jurisdiction inference rule.
-A believes in B's expertise on matters involving X
5. What is idealization and why is it needed?
- finding the beliefs at each stage of a protocol and to help develope and verify protocols

Lecture 65
1. Why do you think plaintext is omitted in a BAN idealization?
-the plaintext is arbitrary and doesn't factor in
2. Some idealized steps seem to refer to beliefs that will happen later in the
protocol. Why would that be?
-It's to show what the sender wants the receiver to believe
3. One benefit of a BAN proof is that it exposes assumptions. Explain that.
-assumptions need to be reasonable.
