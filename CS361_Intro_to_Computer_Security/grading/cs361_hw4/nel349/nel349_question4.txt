Lecture 53
********
1. Why is it important for a digital signature to be non reusable?
	-So it cannot be removed. We don't want anyone to remove money from your account with a check already used.
2. Why is it the hash of the message typically signed, rather than the message itself?
	-One reason is that we handle so much data. Hash the message to something small.
3. What assurance does R gain from the interchange on slide 4?
	-Unforgeable, authentic, no repudiation, tamperproof, not reusable. 

********
Lecture 54
********
1.-A public key and a user’s identity are bound together within a certiﬁcate.
2.-So that Y knows the authenticity of the cryptographic hash of the message.
3. Why is it necessary to have a hash of Y and Ky?
	-The message certiﬁes the binding of Y and Ky
4. What would happen if Z had a public key for X, but it was not trustworthy?
	-Z should be able to forge information to X. Extract information from X.

********
Lecture 55
********
1. What happens at the root of a chain of trust?
	-the chain is rooted at some unimpeachable authority
2. Why does an X.509 certiﬁcate include a “validity interval”?
	-Compares if the certificate has been updated. In cases there is a forgery, a new is created and the validity should be the most recent.
3. What would it mean if the hash and the received value did not match?
	- The value has been modified.

********
Lecture 56
********
1. What are some protocols previously discussed?
	-Cryptographic protocols

2. What may happen if one step of a protocol is ignored?
	-The protocol no longer works.

3. Why must the ciphers commute in order to accomplish the task in slide 4?
	- to share a secret/key

4. Describe how an attacker can extract M from the protocol in slide 6.
	-The two applicationd of Ka cancel out, leaving m ^kb which B can easily decrypt with his own key Kb.

5. Describle how an attacker can extract Ka from the protocol in slide 6.
	-An evesdropper who stores the three messages can XOR combinations of them to extract any of M, Ka,  and Kb.

6. Describle how an attacker can extract Kb from the protocol in slide 6.
	-An evesdropper who stores the three messages can XOR combinations of them to extract any of M, Ka,  and Kb.

7. Why are cryptographic protocols difﬁcult to design and easy to get wrong?
	-Someone always find a vulnerability.

********
Lecture 57
********
1. Explain the importance of protocols in the context of the internet.
	-A protocol is a structured dialogue among two or more parties in a distributed context controlling the syntax, semantics, and synchronization of communication, and designed to accomplish a communication-related function.

2. Explain the importance of cryptographic protocols in the context of the internet.
	-Is a protocol using cryptographic mechanisms to accomplish some security-related function.

3. What are the assumptions of the protocol in slide 6?
	- A and B are going to receive the messages sent. A and B are expecting messages from each other.

4. What are the goals of the protocol in slide 6?
	-Unicity, Authenticity and Confidentiality. 
5. Are the goals of the protocol in slide 6 satisﬁed? Explain.
	It is fatally flawed.
6. How is the protocol in slide 6 ﬂawed?
	B or A never know if a message was sent. 

********
Lecture 58
********
1. Why is it important to know if a protocol includes unnecessary steps or messages?
-We want to look at protocols abstractly and ignore issues at the implementation level.

2. Why is it important to know if a protocol encrypts items that could be sent in the clear?
-We want to make the encryption more efficient. Less predictable.

********
Lecture 59
********
1. Why might it be difﬁcult to answer what constitutes an attack on a crypto- graphic protocol?
	-One musta pretend that an attacker  can access all of the traffic and interject the messages. Protocols are highly asynchronous.
2. Describe potential dangers of a replay attack.
	-It can be used to impersonate and assume the identity of one of the legitimate parties.
3. Are there attacks where an attacker gains no secret information? Explain.
	Interleaving attack in which attacker injects spurious messages into a protocol to disrupt or subvert it.
4. What restrictions are imposed on the attacker?
	-They must have certificates.

5. Why is it important that protocols are asynchronous?
	So that information flows in a less predictable way. A protocol that is hard for an attacker to break.

********
Lecture 60
********
1. Would the Needham-Schroeder protocol work without nonces?
	No, the purpose of the nonces is to make sure the flow of messages is  fresh and no replays from earlier exchanges.

2. For each step of the NS protocol, answer the two questions on slide 5.
	1. -The sender is trying to communicate with the server to generate a nonce that will allow him to connect to B. The server assumes A wants to make a secure connection to B
	2. Sender S responds with a nonce and information about A so that B has access to A.
	The receiver will get necessary certifacates to give to B.
	3. A sends the certificate generated by servers S so that B can decrypt it with Kbs. B assumes it has received the necessary certificate to acces information about A.
	4.B sends a response to A and creates a nonce. The receiver A receives a nonce.
	5. A returns the nonce and B knows that the message is fresh.



********
Lecture 61
********
1. As in slide 5, if A’s key were later changed, after having Kas compromised, how could A still be impersonated?
	The intruder can establish communication with another party with the intension of stealing and impersonating another entity in the party. 
2. Is it fair to ask the question of a key being broken?
	It is always necessary to make the attack less harmful so we might want to consider mitigating the problem of a key being broken.
3. How might you address these flaws if you were the protocol designer?
	I will consider using more frequent and more complex nonces.

********
Lecture 62
********
1. What guarantees does Otway-Rees seem to provide to A and B?
	A number M that is unique. A is communicating directly to B. Is trying to authenticate both parties through each other
2. Are there guarantees that Needham-Schroeder provides that Otway-Rees does not or vice versa?
	- Otway–Rees protocol allows individuals communicating over such a network to prove their identity to each other while also preventing eavesdropping or replay attacks and allowing for the detection of modification.
3. How could you fix the flawed protocol from slide 4?
	We can use a session identifier.

********
Lecture 63
********
1. Why is the verification of protocols important? to learn to think as an attacker and improve the protocol.
2. What is a belief logic?
	- is a formal system for reasoning about beliefs.
3. A protocol is a program; where do you think beliefs come in?
Belief logics allow reasoning about what principals within the protocol should be able to infer from the messages they see

********
Lecture 64
********
1. What is a modal logic? a belief
2. Explain the intuition behind the message meaning inference rule.
	A is a communication between X and B.
3. Explain the intuition behind the nonce verification inference rule.
	If A believes X is fresh and A believes B once said X, then A believes B believes X.

4. Explain the intuition behind the jurisdiction inference rule.
	A has authoritiy over X	

5. What is idealization and why is it needed?
	One purpose of idealization is to omit parts of the message that do not contribute to the beliefs of the recipients.

********
Lecture 65
********
1. Why do you think plaintext is omitted in a BAN idealization?
	Does not contribute to the beliefs of the recipients. In BAN all plaintext
is omitted since it can be forged.

2. Some idealized steps seem to refer to beliefs that will happen later in the
protocol. Why would that be?
	-Use of a logic like BAN shows what is provable and also what must be assumed.


3. One benefit of a BAN proof is that it exposes assumptions. Explain that.
	You can expose assumptions about correctness whether the protocol does or does not meet its security goals. Also efficiency and maybe applicability
