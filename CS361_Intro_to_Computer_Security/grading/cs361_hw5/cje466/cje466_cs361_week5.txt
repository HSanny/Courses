What is PGP?	-> PGP is a “end-run” around government restrictions(software to encrypt)2. What motivated Phil Zimmerman to develop it?	-> Zimmermann had a strong distrust of the government, and	believed strongly that everyone had an absolute right to privacy.3. Does PGP provide effective security?	-> Yes, because US Government agencies find it “nearly impossible” to access 	PGP-encrypted files. It must be because is very secure.4. If PGP is freeware, why would anyone bother to purchase support?	->Because most companies like to get support/maintenance on software and like to have another	party be responsible for that.***********************************Lecture 67***********************************1. Explain the PGP authentication protocol.	-> This is a digital signature function required.	1 Sender creates a message M.	2 Sender generates a hash of M.	3 Sender signs the hash using his private key and prepends the result to the message.	4 Receiver uses the sender’s public key to verify the signature and recover the hash code.	5 Receiver generates a new hash code for M and compares it with the decrypted hash code.2. Explain the PGP confidentiality protocol.	->PGP provides encryption for messages sent or stored as files.	1 Sender generates a message M and a random session key K.	2 M is encrypted using key K.	3 K is encrypted using the recipient’s public key, and prepended to the message.	4 Receiver uses his private key to recover the session key.	5 The session key is used to decrypt the message.3. How do you get both authentication and confidentiality?	->Both authentication and confidentiality may be combined for a given message.	1 Apply the authentication step to the original message.	2 Apply the confidentiality step to the resulting message.***********************************Lecture 68***********************************1. Besides authentication and confidentiality, what other “services” does PGP provide?	->PGP provides the “services” of compression, email compatibility, and segmentation to make 	the system more robust and efficient.2. Why is compression needed?	->Encryption after compression strengthens the encryption, since compression reduces 	redundancy in the message.3. Why sign a message and then compress, rather than the other way around?	->As a default, PGP compresses the message, using the ZIP compression algorithm, after 	applying the signature and before encryption. It is done in this order because:	It is preferable to sign an uncompressed message so that the	signature does not depend on the compression algorithm.	Versions of the compression algorithm behave slightly	differently, though all version are interoperable.4. Explain radix-64 conversion and why it’s needed?	->PGP uses radix-64 conversion to map groups of three octets into four ASCII characters. Also 	appends a CRC for data error checking. By default, even ASCII is converted. Use of radix-64 	expands the message by 33%. This is usually more than offset by the compression.5. Why is PGP segmentation needed?	-> To deal with long messages. PGP automatically segments messages that are too large. This is	done after all of the other steps, including radix-64 conversion.	Thus, signature and session key appear only once.***********************************Lecture 69***********************************1. What are the four kinds of keys used by PGP?	->PGP makes use of four types of keys: one-time session symmetric	keys, public keys, private keys, passphrase-based symmetric keys.2. What special properties are needed of session keys?	->Session keys: used once and generated for each new message3. How are session keys generated?	->The encryption algorithm E is used to generate a new n-bit key	from a previous session key and two n/2-bit blocks generated	based on user keystrokes, including keystroke timing. The two	blocks are encrypted using E and the previous key, and combined	to form the new key.4. Assuming RSA is used for PGP asymmetric encryption, how are the keys generated?	->For new RSA keys, an odd number n of sufficient size (usually > 200 bits) is generated and 	tested for primality. If it is not prime, then repeat with another randomly generated number, 	until a prime is found. Primes appear in the neighborhood of n about every ln(n) = lge(n)	numbers.5. How are the private keys protected? Why is this necessary?	->The private key is encrypted using CAST-128 with 128 bits of the hash code as key. The key 	is then discarded. Since the security of the system depends on protecting private	keys, these are encrypted using a passphrase system.***********************************Lecture 70***********************************1. If a user has multiple private/public key pairs, how does he know which was    used when he receives an encrypted message?    -> Send the public key along with the message. Inefficient, since the key might be thousands     of bits. Associate a unique ID with each key pair and send that with the message. Would     require that all senders know that mapping of keys to ID’s for all recipients. Generate an ID     likely to be unique for a given user. This is PGP’s solution. Use the least significant 64-    bits of the key as the ID.2. What’s on a user’s private key ring?	->This is used by the receiver to verify that he has such a key on his “key ring.” The 	associated private key is used for the decryption. Associates the timestamp.3. What’s on a user’s public key ring?	-> Public keys of other users are stored on a user’s public-key ring.	This is a table of rows containing timestamp, key ID, public key and user ID.4. What are the steps in retrieving a private key from the key ring?	->PGP retrieves receiver’s encrypted private key from the private-key ring, using the Key ID 	field in the session key component of the message as an index. 2 PGP prompts the user for the 	passphrase to recover the unencrypted private key. 3 PGP recovers the session key and decrypts 	the message.5. What is the key legitimacy field for?	->Legitimacy is determined from certificates and chains of certificates, the user’s assessment 	of the trust to be assigned to the key, and various heuristics for computing trust.6. How is a key revoked?	->The owner issues a signed key revocation certificate.***********************************Lecture 71***********************************1. Explain the difference between the consumer and producer problems. Whichis more prevalent?	->the consumer problem: (also called “man-in-the-middle”attack) the attacker gets logically 	between the client and service and somehow disrupts the communication. 2 the producer problem: 	the attacker produces, offers orrequests so many services that the server is overwhelmed.2. Explain syn flooding.	->A SYN Flooding attack happens when an attacker forges the return address on a number of SYN 	packets. The server fills its table with these half-open connections.3. Why are the first three solutions to syn flooding not ideal?	->An attacker can either block traﬃc from clients (the consumer problem) or ﬂood the server (the producer problem)***********************************Lecture 72***********************************1. Why does packet filtering work very well to prevent attacks?	->A ﬁlter or packet sniﬀer can detect patterns of identiﬁers in the request stream and block messages in that pattern. 	Ingress ﬁltering means sniﬃng incoming packets and discarding those with source IP addresses outside a given range (e.g., those known to be reachable via that interface).2. What are the differences between intrusion detection and intrusion preventionsystems?	-> An intrusion detection system (IDS) can analyze traﬃc patterns and react to anomalous patterns. However, often there is 	nothing apparently wrong but the volume of requests. An IDS reacts after the attack has begun.3. Explain the four different solutions mentioned to DDoS attacks.	-> A DDos attack comes when an attacker takes over a number of nodes in a network and uses them as bots to launch a	coordinated producer attack.***********************************Lecture 73***********************************1. Explain false positive and false negatives. Which is worse?	->False positives: harmless behavior is mis-classiﬁed as an attack.	False negatives: a genuine attack is not detected2. Explain what “accurate” and “precise” mean in the IDS context.	->An intrusion detection system is: accurate: if it detects all genuine attacks; precise: if it never reports legitimate 	behavior as an attack. It is easy to make an IDS that is either accurate or precise! Why?	It’s hard to do both simultaneously.3. Explain the statement: “It’s easy to build an IDS that is either accurate orprecise?	-> Making a system that is both precise and accurate is very hard. 4. What is the base rate fallacy? Why is it relevant to an IDS?	->An intrusion detection system (IDS) can analyze traﬃc patterns and react to anomalous patterns. However, often there is nothing apparently wrong but the volume of requests.***********************************Lecture 74***********************************1. What did Code Red version 1 attempt to do?	->On July 13, 2001, investigators from eEye Digital Security worked overnight to analyze the worm. The called it “CodeRed” 	because of the CodeRed Mountain Dew they were drinking and because of the “Hacked by Chinese” message.2. Why was Code Red version 1 ineffective?	->The worm uses a static seed in its random number generator and thus generates identical lists of IP addresses on each	infected machine. Each infected machine probed the same list of machines, so	the worm spread slowly. The IP address for www1.whitehouse.gov was changed so	the DoS attack failed.3. What does it mean to say that a worm is “memory resident”? What are theimplications.	->worm is memory resident. A machine can be disinfected by simply rebooting it.4. Why was Code Red version 2 much more effective than version 1?	->Version 2 had a much greater impact on global infrastructure due to the sheer volume of hosts infected and probes sent to	infect new hosts.***********************************Lecture 75***********************************1. How was Code Red II related to Code Red (versions 1 and 2)?	-> When the worm infects a new host, it ﬁrst determines if the system has already been infected.	If not, the worm initiates its propagation mechanism, sets up a “backdoor” into the infected machine, becomes dormant for a day, and then reboots the machine. It also exploited the buffer-overflow vulnerability.2. Why do you suppose Code Red II incorporated its elaborate propogationscheme?	-> CodeRedII generates a random IP address and then applies a mask to produce the addresses to probe3. What did Code Red II attempt to do?	->Installs a mechanism for remote, root-level access to the infected	machine. This backdoor allows any code to be executed, so the	machines could be used as zombies for future attacks.4. Comment on the implications of a large population of unpatched machines.	-> Domino effect, one machine could be use to infect more machines.5. Comment on the report from Verizon cited on slide 6. What are the lessonsof their study?	->They should of patch it before hand***********************************Lecture 76***********************************1. Why is a certification regime for secure products necessary and useful?	-> Because people want quality, better when someone had tested the product 2. Explain the components of an evaluation standard.	->	  - A set of requirements defining security functionality.	  - A set of assurance requirements that are needed to establish the funcionality requirements.	  - A methodology to determine whether the functional requirements are met.	  - A mesaure of evaluation result that indicates how trustworthy the evaluated system.3. Why would crypto devices have a separate evaluation mechanism?	-> identifying the product that will meet those requirements4. Explain the four levels of certification for crypto devices.	->	  - Basic security: At least one approved function or algorithm	  - Improved physsical security, and tamper evident packaging.	  - Strong tamper-resistance as well as countermeasures.	  - Envelope protection***********************************Lecture 77***********************************1. What is the Common Criteria?	->The need for secure systems evaluation criteria led numerous countries to develop their own. This has largely been replaced by The Common Criteria, adopted by some 26 countries, including	the U.S. It comprises: the CC documents, the CC Evaluation Methodology (CEM),	country-speciﬁc evaluation methodologies called an Evaluation Scheme or National Scheme2. What’s “common” about it?	->The Common Criteria, adopted standards by some 26 countries.3. Why would there be any need for “National Schemes”?	-> Each country wants to have their seperate set of methods4. Explain the difference between a protection profile and a security target.	->A PP is a description of a family of products in terms of threats,	environmental issues and assumptions, security objectives, and	requirements of the Common Criteria***********************************Lecture 78***********************************1. Explain the overall goal of the protection profile as exemplified by theWBISexample.	->Trash containers have ID tags, read via short-range radio by trucks	that weigh them as trash is collected, stores the information and	later transmits it to government oﬃces for billing. ID tags contain	numbers that are unique but not conﬁdential.2. What is the purpose of the various parts of the protection profile (as exemplifiedin the WBIS example)?	-> To have a system that can deal with with threads on assumptions that are being made.3. What is the purpose of the matrix on slide 7?	-> To give us a visialization***********************************Lecture 79***********************************1. Explain the overall goal of the security target evaluation as exemplified bythe Sun Identity Manager example.	-> To define security. Sun Java System Identity Manager is a product for managing user	access privileges stored in directory services.	2. How do you think that a security target evaluation differs from a protectionprofile evaluation?	Assumptions	OE.NoUntrusted: no untrusted users on the system	OE.Time: the OS has reliable time stamps	Threats	T.BadPasswords: users may have selected guessable passwords	T.Abuse: authorized users perform bad actions	T.Mismanage: administrators don’t manage security well	T.Privil: unauthorized user gains access	T.Undetect: attack attempts go undetected	T.Walkaway: a user leaves workstation without logging out***********************************Lecture 80***********************************1. What are the EALs and what are they used for?	->Evaluation under the Common Criteria targets a speciﬁed level of	rigor. The vendor provides assurance that the corresponding rigor	was applied during development and test2. Who performs the Common Criteria evaluations?	-> Independent labs3. Speculate why the higher EALs are not necessarily mutually recognized byvarious countries.	->Issuing a CC certiﬁcation means that the government of the	country where the evaluation is performed believes the evaluation	was conducted properly.4. Can vendors certify their own products? Why or why not?	->Indicates a good faith eﬀort to ensure the product meets the	claims of the vendor. Does not assure absolute correctness or	suitability to particular requirements. Does not preclude vendor	“over-marketing.”5. If you’re performing a formal evaluation, why is it probably bad to reverseengineer the model from the code?	-> Because you want to build the system to specification not the other way around********************************************************************************Note: The answer to some of this questions are straight from the lecture slides.********************************************************************************Well done!***********************************
