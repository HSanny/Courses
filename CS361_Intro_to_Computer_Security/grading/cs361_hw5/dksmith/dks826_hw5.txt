Questions Week 5

----------------------------------------Lecture 66 Questions-------------------------------
1. PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy and is a package of strong encryption algorithms for the average person to use.

2. Zimmerman was untrustful of the government and believe people should have privacy from it.

3. Yes by using Assymetric, Semmetric and Hash encoding.

4. The question answers itself. People will buy a commercial version for support if perhaps they run a business.

----------------------------------------Lecture 67 Questions-------------------------------
1. The PGP authentication protocol involves the sender hashing a message and signing the result with their private key and sending it along with the message itself. When the reciever gets what was sent it can use the senders public key to decrypted the hashed message, hash the message that came along with it, and then compare the results.

2. The PGP confidentiality protocol starts by generating a session key which will provide fast symmetric encryption and decryption and encrypting it with the recievers public key. The sender sends that along with the message encrypted with the session key. The reviever then decrypts the session key using its private key and then decrypts the message using the decrypted key. 

3. By using both protocols you achieve both authentication and confidentiality. You take the result of the authentication step and use it as the message in the confidentiality step. That way you know it arrived confidentialy and the sender can be authenticated.

----------------------------------------Lecture 68 Questions-------------------------------
1. Compression, email compatibility, and segmentation.

2. To save bandwidth.

3. Because you want the original message signed.

4. Radix-64 expands sets of 3 octets into 4 ASCII characters. This is done because every email system can hande ASCII, but may not be able to handle control characters in the original message. This way insures email compatibility.

5. It is needed because emailers have a max message size. 

----------------------------------------Lecture 69 Questions-------------------------------
1. There are session keys, public and private keys, and passphrase based keys.

2. They need to be high entropy (random appearing) and hard to guess. 

3. They are generated by performing CASR-128 on a previous key and two 64 bit blocks generated based on user keystrokes.

4. By generating two large prime numbers that are not geussable. 

5. They are protected by using a passphrase based encryption in which an entered passphras is hashed to form the key to decrypt the private key.

----------------------------------------Lecture 70 Questions-------------------------------
1. The PGP system uses the last 64 bits of the key as an ID so the reciever knows which key to decrypt with.

2. The private key ring containes a table with a timestamp, a key ID, the public key, the private key, and the user ID.

3. The public key ring containes a timestamp, a key ID, the public key, and the user ID.

4. They are protected by using a passphrase based encryption in which an entered passphras is hashed to form the key to decrypt the private key.

5. It is a measure of how strongly you believe that a key belongs to another user. 

6. The owner sends out a key revocation vertificate.

----------------------------------------Lecture 71 Questions-------------------------------
1. The consumer problem is a disruption of the communication between a client and a server, while the producer problem is the overwhelming of a server and is more prevalent. 

2. In syn flooding an attacker sends SYN requests to a server with false return addresses to fill up the servers half open tables while it waites for a response. 

3. Increasing the server queue size will take a lot of room and just allow for more false syns to be stored. Shortening the time out period will disadvantage slower clients. Filtering suspicious packets is too difficult to implement.

----------------------------------------Lecture 72 Questions-------------------------------
1. Filtering works by finding patterns of bad packets and filtering packets within that pattern, or by blocking packets with an address outside a given range.

2. Intrusion detection looks within a system to see if an attack has made it past a firewall while an intrusion prevention system tries to make sure no attacks make it through.

3. Over provisioning the Network is to use more servers to handle an attack. Filtering packets is an attempt at distinguishing bad packets from good and blocking them. Slow down processing disadvantages everyone. The "Speak up " solution is to request that all clients send you even more requests so that the good to bad packet ratio favors your clients.

----------------------------------------Lecture 73 Questions-------------------------------
1. A false positive is to see harmless behavior as an attack, and a false negative is to not detect a genuine attack. Which problem is worse depends on the specific problem.

2. Accurate means to detect all genuine attacks so that you have no false negatives. Precise means never reporting normal behavior as an attack so that you have no false positives.

3. Because you can declare all traffic as an attack or as legitimate so that you are 100 percent accurate or 100 percent precise, but not both.

4. Base rate fallacy is having a lot of false positives. It is relevant to IDS because you need high accuracy and precision to avoid false positives. 

----------------------------------------Lecture 74 Questions-------------------------------
1. CodeRed1 attempted to infect numerous computers to launch a dos attack against www.whitehouse.org.

2. It failed because the random ip generator had a static seed and so attemted to infect the same ip's over and over.

3. It resides in the volatile memory of a machine, so a reboot will clear it of the worm.

4. It had a randomly generated seed which had a better infection affect. It would also crash machines with targeted IP's such as rounters and printers which would crash if the worm tried to infect it.

----------------------------------------Lecture 75 Questions-------------------------------
1. They were not very related except that the author of CodeRedII included the string CodeRed in the code.

2. To infect a larger number of machines.

3. It would install a backdoor into the machine and then spread itself.

4. There is a large number of unpatched machines, meaning the two worms can keep propigating themselves throught these machinge.

5. Many people are bad at patching their machines even if they are available before a virus is released.

----------------------------------------Lecture 76 Questions-------------------------------
1. Since most consumers are not security experts, we can trust in a certification to inform us on the quality of a security product. 

2. An evaluation standard should include a set of requirements to define the security functionality. A set of assurance requirements, a method to see if the functional requirements are met, and a way to evaluate the result and trustworthyness of the system. 

3. Because there are not that many experts in the field of cryptography.

4. The FIPS 140-2 levels are:
	L1: basic security using at least one crypto algorithm
	L2: improves physical security and packing makes it tamper evident
	L3: has stronger tamper resistance and countermeasures
	L4: complete envelope of protection and deletes keys if detects tamperint. 

----------------------------------------Lecture 77 Questions-------------------------------
1. The Common Criteria is a set of rules to evaluate the security of a system that holds internationaly.

2. The fact that different nations have to hold to those standards.

3. Because some countries may not trust other counries evaluations above a certain level.

4. A protection profile is a mock up of what security requirements a class of product or system should meet, and an evaluation of a security target is to evaluate a product or system against those standards.

----------------------------------------Lecture 78 Questions-------------------------------
1. The overall goal of the protection profile is to make sure the data collected by the WBIS is secure.

2. To make sure you have authentication and data integrity.

3. To make sure there are no holes in the system. If all the rows have an X in them somewhere, you know you have a mechanism to address each threat.

----------------------------------------Lecture 79 Questions-------------------------------
1. To pass EAL2 security level by managing data securely.

2. In security target evaluation you have to describe how you counter specific threats in your policy while protection profile evaluation must only show that the requirements show that these threats must be met. 
----------------------------------------Lecture 80 Questions-------------------------------
1. EAL's are the Evaluation Assurance Levels givin to products that meet certain standards.\

2. Evaluation tests must be performed by an independent organization accredited to perform CC testing.

3. Because systems evaluated at that level will not be comercial product, but those used in government environments. 

4. No, vendors cannot certify there own systems. The must be evaluated by the NSA or a government accredited organization.

5. You need a formal model to prove that the system is secure.
