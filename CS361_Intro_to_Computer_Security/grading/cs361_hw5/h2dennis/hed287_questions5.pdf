CS361 Questions: Week 5
Lecture 66
1. What is PGP?
Pretty good privacy.
2. What motivated Phil Zimmerman to develop it?
Wanting to make privacy pretty good.
3. Does PGP provide effective security?
Yes
4. If PGP is freeware, why would anyone bother to purchase support?
To get bonus features.
Lecture 67
1. Explain the PGP authentication protocol.
To authenticate a person pretty good.
2. Explain the PGP confidentiality protocol.
To confidentiate a person pretty good.
3. How do you get both authentication and confidentiality?
With asymmetric keys.
Lecture 68
1. Besides authentication and confidentiality, what other “services” does PGP
provide?
Fixing the security in your computer.
2. Why is compression needed?
For efficiency purposes.
3. Why sign a message and then compress, rather than the other way around?
Again, for efficiency purposes.
4. Explain radix-64 conversion and why it’s needed?
To make integrity as well as the others.
5. Why is PGP segmentation needed?
For security and efficiency.
Lecture 69
1. What are the four kinds of keys used by PGP?
Two symmetric and two asymmetric.
2. What special properties are needed of session keys?
Bring confidentiality.
3. How are session keys generated?
To make integrity as well as the others.
4. Assuming RSA is used for PGP asymmetric encryption, how are the keys
generated?
For security and efficiency.
5. How are the private keys protected? Why is this necessary?
To make integrity as well as the others.
Lecture 70
1. If a user has multiple private/public key pairs, how does he know which was
used when he receives an encrypted message?
To make integrity as well as the others.
2. What’s on a user’s private key ring?
The private key.
3. What’s on a user’s public key ring?
The public key.
4. What are the steps in retrieving a private key from the key ring?
Hiding it from others.
5. What is the key legitimacy field for?
Key legitimacy.
6. How is a key revoked?
By revoking it.
Lecture 71
1. Explain the difference between the consumer and producer problems. Which
is more prevalent?
One is consumer related
2. Explain syn flooding.
Flooding of sinew.
3. Why are the first three solutions to syn flooding not ideal?
Because they don’t reach a conclusion.
Lecture 72
1. Why does packet filtering work very well to prevent attacks?
It filters the packets.
2. What are the differences between intrusion detection and intrusion prevention
systems?
It intrudes.
3. Explain the four different solutions mentioned to DDoS attacks.
They are all good.
Lecture 73
1. Explain false positive and false negatives. Which is worse?
False positives.
2. Explain what “accurate” and “precise” mean in the IDS context.
They mean what they mean.
3. Explain the statement: “It’s easy to build an IDS that is either accurate or
precise?
It’s a statement.
4. What is the base rate fallacy? Why is it relevant to an IDS?
Fallacy at the base.
Lecture 74
1. What did Code Red version 1 attempt to do?
To make more security.
2. Why was Code Red version 1 ineffective?
Because it was ineffective.
3. What does it mean to say that a worm is “memory resident”? What are the
implications.
The worm is caught by the bird.
4. Why was Code Red version 2 much more effective than version 1?
Because it is.
Lecture 75
1. How was Code Red II related to Code Red (versions 1 and 2)?
The version that works
2. Why do you suppose Code Red II incorporated its elaborate propogation
scheme?
Propogation is a big word.
3. What did Code Red II attempt to do?
Attempts at redding the goat.
4. Comment on the implications of a large population of unpatched machines.
Twang in MGS style.
5. Comment on the report from Verizon cited on slide 6. What are the lessons
of their study?
It is not an improvement.
Lecture 76
1. Why is a certification regime for secure products necessary and useful?
Add number to the end.
2. Explain the components of an evaluation standard.
In case they forget their pin number
3. Why would crypto devices have a separate evaluation mechanism?
To remake the games.
4. Explain the four levels of certification for crypto devices.
The remastered version.
Lecture 77
1. What is the Common Criteria?
To tell a tale.
2. What’s “common” about it?
The perfect dark high defintion.
3. Why would there be any need for “National Schemes”?
Scheme with the ghost program.
4. Explain the difference between a protection profile and a security target.
All shall have their subject defended.
Lecture 78
1. Explain the overall goal of the protection profile as exemplified by theWBIS
example.
Nobody is poor enough to not afford free.
2. What is the purpose of the various parts of the protection profile (as exemplified
in the WBIS example)?
To erase the content.
3. What is the purpose of the matrix on slide 7?
Can’t give the five dollars.
Lecture 79
1. Explain the overall goal of the security target evaluation as exemplified by
the Sun Identity Manager example.
Five dollars shall not be given.
2. How do you think that a security target evaluation differs from a protection
profile evaluation?
The seal team is good.
Lecture 80
1. What are the EALs and what are they used for?
Stay away from the remake area.
2. Who performs the Common Criteria evaluations?
The fans of the system will rearrange the stuff.
3. Speculate why the higher EALs are not necessarily mutually recognized by
various countries.
The new vision will be full.
4. Can vendors certify their own products? Why or why not?
The mesh can’t do it.
5. If you’re performing a formal evaluation, why is it probably bad to reverse
engineer the model from the code?
It shall render the other things obsolete.
