Lecture 66
1)
  It is a publically available tool for encrypting email messages with some of the best algorithms packaged in a very nice way.

2)
  He was motivated by a strong distrust of the goverment.

3)
  Private company or groups with commercial purposes could want to buy
  support.

Lecture 67
1)
  The authentication protcol involes creating a message and getting its' 
  hash value then signing that value and sending it along with the message.

2)
  A random session key is generated and is then used to encrypt the
  message then the key is encryted with the recipients' public key. 
  
3)
  This is done by first applying the authentication protcol to the messge 
  then applying the confidentiality protocol after it with the 
  authenticated message.

Lecture 68
1)
  Compression, email compatibility and segmentation.

2)
  Compression is needed in order to save bandwidth when sending a message 
  across the internet.

3)
  This is good because you do not want the signature to depend on the 
  compression algorithm.

4)
  It converts octetes into four ascii characters so that the systems 
  recieving the message do not mistake part of a message for a command
  the device knows.

5)
  Segmentation is needed because a lot of email services have message
  size restrictions and it allows it to send arbitrarily long messages.

Lecture 69
1)
  Session keys, public keys, private keys, passphrase-based keys.

2)
  The algorithm used to generate it must have a high entropy and must
  be very hard for someone to guess or generate.

3)
  This is done by taking the previous key and taking entropy data
  from things such as key strokes and combining them to make a new
  key.

4)
  A very large number of appropriate size and test it for being a prime
  until you get one.

5)
  Private keys are protected by encryption from the generated passphrase
  based key and then stored. It is necessary to protect private keys so 
  that an attacker is not able to look at all of your messages freely.

Lecture 70
1)
  This is done by generating an ID likely to be unique for
  a given user by taking the least significant 64 bits.

2)
  The private key ring keeps a users private keys, the timestamp of 
  when it was created, the key id, the associated public key and
  the user idea.

3)
  The public key ring  has a timestamp of when the entry was created,
   the key ID the public key itself, and a user ID.

4)
  To retrieve a private key a user has to input their passphrase,
  it is then hashed and that is used to decrypt the message.

5)
  Key legitimacy field is used to store certificates for public
  keys.

6)
  A key is revoke by sending out revocation certificates to all
  users they are talking to.

Lecture 71
1)
  The difference is that in the consumer problem an attacker is blocking the consumer from getting
  to a site while the producer problem is when an attacker prevents a producer from being able
  to recieve new clients.

2)
  An attacker sends the synchronization packets to ther server and when the server saves the packets
  and eventually there is no room for legitimate clients.

3)
  They are not ideal because either cost a lot more, cause slower clients to not be able to connect
  and the third has a possibility is difficult to do correctly.

Lecture 72
1)
  It does not work very well because it is hard to determine what is a 
  "good" packet and what is a bad packet well but very easy to get
  wrong.

2)
  Instrusion dection recognizes when something bad is behind a firewall while intrusion
  prevent trys to keep things from getting in.

3)
  Overprovisioning: having too many servers to be overwhelmed
  filtering attack packets: distinguish between an attack packet and a normal one
  slow down processing: slows down all requestors
  speak up solution: request additional traffic from all requestors

Lecture 73
1)
  A false negative is worse because something bad is actually
  happening but you did not notice. Though in certain instances
  flase positives can be more harmful.

2)
  Accurate means that it detects all guine attacks and has no false negatives.
  Precise means it never reports legitimate behavior as an attack so no false
  positives.

3)
  It is easy to be over protective and have a lot of false positives or
  Be more lax and only report real attacks but hard to find a middle ground
  between the two that works well.

4)
  Base rate fallacy is the rate at which an attack occurs this is relevant
  because it can help you determine how you want to set up a system given
  the amount of times an attack is likely to occur. The smaller the likelyhood
  the more accuracy required.

Lecture 74
1)
  It attempted a denial of service attack against the white house or to infect other
  computers.

2)
  It was ineffective because it used a static seed point from which to start its'
  psudo random number generation. This meant that it only affected a certain range of computers.

3)
  Memory resident which means that it was in volitile memory of a computer which meant that
  to get it off a computer all you had to do was reboot the computer.

4)
  It has a randomly generated seed instead of a static one so it was able to reach a lot 
  more machines.

Lecture 75
1)
  They were not related except for the fact that the writer of two knew
  that Code Red existed.

2)
  Code Red II probably used an elaborate propagation scheme in order to 
  reach the largest possible number of computers.

3)
  Code Red II was trying to install back doors in computers that it infected.

4)
  A large population of unpatched machines means that the worms will continue to propgagate.

5)
  The lesson is that people are bad at patching their machines and that is something
  that makes the internet a more vulnerable and dangerous place.

Lecture 76
1)
  It is necessary and useful because it allows people who are not experts to
  buy and use software that meets their needs.

2)
  A set of requirements defining security functionality
    defines what different levels of security mean
  A set of asurance requirements needed for establishing the funcitonal requirements
    defines the policies of catagories
  A methodology for determining that the functional requirements are met
    defines the way evaluations happend
  A measure of the evaluation result indicating the trustworthiness of the evaluated system
    goves grade to suites that help people understand how good they are

3)
  They would have a seperate evaluation mechanism because cryptology is something
  that is sensitive to the government because they don't want criminals hiding
  the bad things they do.

4)
  Level 1:
    basic security at least one approved algorithms or functions
  Level 2:
    improved physical security tamper evident packaging
  Level 3:
    strong tamper-resistance and countermeasures
  Level 4:
    complete envelope of protections including immediate zeroing of keys upon tampering.

Lecture 77
1)
  The common criteria is a set of documents and methodology that show how
  secrure systems evaluation are completed in signing countries for the most part.

2)
  It is common because it is used between 26 countries which have adopted it.

3)
  The is a need for "National Schemes" at higher levels of security some nations
  might allow of require more from security.

4)
  A proctection profile is a descirption of a fanily of products and the criteria for what they can
  be attacked and protected while a security target is the security requirements of a single product not a family.

Lecture 78
1)
  The overal goal of the protection profile is to create a layout of what they system needs to protects and show
  the different ways that have been thought up to attack the system.

2)
  The various parts of the protoections profile are supposed to give someone an overview of the situation from 
  varying view points so that someone can understand what is being considered and how it is being protected.

3)
  The purpose of the matrix is so that you can systematically decide whether the system being proposed is
  adequate enough to solve the problem.

Lecture 79
1)
  The overall goal of the security target evaluation is to show what is being protected and the ways in which
  it is achieving the goals which are in accordance with a certain level of security.

2)
  A security target evaluation differs from a protection profile evaluation is that a security target evaluation
  is on a specific matter giving ways to protect something while a protection profile merely gives a general 
  overview of what should or needs to be protected with general solutions.

Lecture 80
1)
  EALs are evaluation assurance levels, and are used to show the level 
  of which a protection profile or security target someone submits is assured
  to have been tested.

2)
  The government of the country where the evaluation is sought 
  perform Common Criteria evaluations.

3)
  They are not neccesssarily mutally recognized because of differing standards 
  and potentially laws in different countries.

4)
  No they cannot. This would cause a sever conflict of interests.

5)
  It is probably bad to reverse engineer a model from code because it means that the code
  was not built upon a formal mathmatical proof that the algorithm worked and if you try to reverse
  engineer the model your code may not reflect the proof once it is fully reverse engineered.
