Lecture 66
1. What is PGP?
-pretty good privacy, a program that bundles cryptographic algorithms
2. What motivated Phil Zimmerman to develop it?
-distrust of the government
3. Does PGP provide effective security?
-yes, very
4. If PGP is freeware, why would anyone bother to purchase support?
-to have reliable tech support

Lecture 67
1. Explain the PGP authentication protocol.
-the sender sends signed hash of the message
2. Explain the PGP confidentiality protocol.
-encrypt message with session key, then send the encrypted message and the publicly encrpyted key
3. How do you get both authentication and confidentiality?
-the signature is included withe the message

Lecture 68
1. Besides authentication and confidentiality, what other “services” does PGP
provide?
-compression, email compatibility, segmentation
2. Why is compression needed?
-to increase throughput
3. Why sign a message and then compress, rather than the other way around?
-smaller size
4. Explain radix-64 conversion and why it’s needed?
-because translates the data into ascii which is universal
5. Why is PGP segmentation needed?
-to ensure that any email system can accept the message size

Lecture 69
1. What are the four kinds of keys used by PGP?
-public/private keys, symetric keys session and passphrase based
2. What special properties are needed of session keys?
-symetric and random
3. How are session keys generated?
-encrypting the previous key and entropy collected from user input
4. Assuming RSA is used for PGP asymmetric encryption, how are the keys
generated?
-2 large primes are generated
5. How are the private keys protected? Why is this necessary?
-a passphrase, to protect the private keys

Lecture 70
1. If a user has multiple private/public key pairs, how does he know which was
used when he receives an encrypted message?
-using the attached key id
2. What’s on a user’s private key ring?
-all the users private keys and their timestamp, key id, public key, and user ID
3. What’s on a user’s public key ring?
-all the imported public keys with their timestamp, user ID, and key id
4. What are the steps in retrieving a private key from the key ring?
-enter the passphrase
5. What is the key legitimacy field for?
-to indicate the level of certainty in the viability of the public key
6. How is a key revoked?
-issue a revocation certificate

Lecture 71
1. Explain the difference between the consumer and producer problems. Which
is more prevalent?
-consumer problems is where the client can't conneted because of a man in the middle.
Producer problem is when a server gets flooded.
2. Explain syn flooding.
-a bot net sends syn packets with fake return addresses which floods the server
3. Why are the first three solutions to syn flooding not ideal?
-they can affect the service to the clients

Lecture 72
1. Why does packet filtering work very well to prevent attacks?
-doesn't work well because it's difficult to determine which packets are valid
2. What are the differences between intrusion detection and intrusion preven-
tion systems?
-IDS tries to find intrusions that are occurring in the system. Intrusion prevention tries to stop attacks from penetrating from the outside
3. Explain the four different solutions mentioned to DDoS attacks.
-packet filtering - attempts to filter out malicous packets
-slow down processsing
-add more resources
-speak up solution -  requests that legit customers send more packets so the percentage of valid requests improves

Lecture 73
1. Explain false positive and false negatives. Which is worse?
-false possitive classifies a legit action as a threat. false negative is when a an attack goes undetected.
2. Explain what “accurate” and “precise” mean in the IDS context.
-accurate finds all threats, precise never finds false positives
3. Explain the statement: “It’s easy to build an IDS that is either accurate or
precise?
-It could just deny or accept all requests
4. What is the base rate fallacy? Why is it relevant to an IDS?
-high percentage on a rare even can still result in mostly false alarms.

Lecture 74
1. What did Code Red version 1 attempt to do?
-flood whitehouse website
2. Why was Code Red version 1 ineffective?
-used a static seed for random generator
3. What does it mean to say that a worm is “memory resident”? What are the
implications.
-it lives in the volitile ram which is cleared with a reboot
4. Why was Code Red version 2 much more effective than version 1?
-used a random seed

Lecture 75
1. How was Code Red II related to Code Red (versions 1 and 2)?
-Codered2 was inspired by code red but did not flood the whitehouse site
2. Why do you suppose Code Red II incorporated its elaborate propogation
scheme?
-for profuse propagation
3. What did Code Red II attempt to do?
-create a botnet
4. Comment on the implications of a large population of unpatched machines.
-China did not seem as worried as the US in patching
5. Comment on the report from Verizon cited on slide 6. What are the lessons
of their study?
-computers should be patched ASAP to avoid being infected

Lecture 76
1. Why is a certification regime for secure products necessary and useful?
-useful for consumers to judge the security of a product
2. Explain the components of an evaluation standard.
-requirements for functionality, assurances, methodology and trustworthiness
3. Why would crypto devices have a separate evaluation mechanism?
-they are not well understood by the public
4. Explain the four levels of certification for crypto devices.
-level 1: lowest level, includes 1 approved algorithm
-level 2: includes phyisical security mechanisms, 
-level 3: mechanisms will erase data if tampered with
-level 4: high probability of an intrustion being detected

Lecture 77
1. What is the Common Criteria?
-international criteria for cryptographic devices
2. What’s “common” about it?
-Many countries accept it
3. Why would there be any need for “National Schemes”?
-for higher standards of security accepted by each country
4. Explain the difference between a protection profile and a security target.
-the policy(security requirements) is the security target, protection profile is a description of a class of products and the security model

Lecture 78
1. Explain the overall goal of the protection profile as exemplified by the WBIS
example.
-to ensure that preserve the integrity of the data
2. What is the purpose of the various parts of the protection profile (as exem-
plified in the WBIS example)?
-to define the security environment and goals
3. What is the purpose of the matrix on slide 7?
-to visualize that all threats and assumptions have been accounted for

Lecture 79
1. Explain the overall goal of the security target evaluation as exemplified by
the Sun Identity Manager example.
-to ensure that the security policy is well thought out
2. How do you think that a security target evaluation differs from a protection
profile evaluation?
-a security target evalutation is more specific to a certain product

Lecture 80
1. What are the EALs and what are they used for?
-Certification levels to indicate how rigorously the security has been demonstrated to match the PP
2. Who performs the Common Criteria evaluations?
-Governments or other agencies
3. Speculate why the higher EALs are not necessarily mutually recognized by
various countries.
-Countries don't necessarly accept the standard of other countries.
4. Can vendors certify their own products? Why or why not?
-No, it must be certified by a 3rd party
5. If you’re performing a formal evaluation, why is it probably bad to reverse
engineer the model from the code?
-the code can be very complicated, making it difficult to infer the model

Well done!
