Lecture 66 (PGP)
1. PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy and is used in a form of email encryption system that is extremely strong and is easy to use and accessible to all.

2. Phil Zimmerman was motivated to develop PGP because he did not trust the government.

3. PGP provides effective security because major authorities, US Government, Italian Police, etc. could not break the encryption.

4. Companies would bother to purchase support instead of using freeware of PGP because the purchased version is more likely to come with technical support in case there is something wrong in the software.

/************************************************************/
Lecture 67 (PGP Services)
1. The PGP authentication protocol involves a digital signature function. The sender creates a message, generates a hash for that message, encrypts that hashed message with its private key and prepends it to the message. The receiver is able to use the senders’ public key to decrypt the hashed message, compute the hash function and see if it matches the original message. This protocol does not guarantee confidentiality because the message is sent in the clear but it does ensure authentication because the sender uses its private key to encrypt the hashed message.

2. The PGP confidentiality protocol involves encryption on messages. The sender generates a message and a random session key and encrypts the random session key with the receivers’ public key and encrypts the message with the session key. The receiver can use its private key to get the session key and then use the session key to retrieve the message. This protocol does not guarantee authentication because anyone with can encrypt with the receivers’ public key.

3. You get both authentication and confidentiality by applying both the authentication and confidentiality protocols on the message. Apply the authentication step to the original message and apply the confidentiality step to the resulting message.

/************************************************************/
Lecture 68 (PGP Services II)
1. PGP provides Compression, Email compatibility, and Segmentation.

2. Compression is needed in order to reduce that amount of bandwidth that is sent over the network.

3. A message should be signed and then compressed rather than the around way around because it is preferable to sign an uncompressed message so that the signature does not depend on the compression algorithm.

4. Radix-64 conversion is implemented the the Email compatability service so that can be uniformly followed by a majority of email systems. The conversion takes groups of 3-octets and converts them into four ASCII characters.

5. PGP segmentation is needed in order to break up longer messages so that email systems are able to accept the messages.
/************************************************************/


/************************************************************/
Lecture 69 (PGP Key Management)
1. The four kinds of keys used by PGP are the session keys, public keys, private keys, and passphrase-based keys.

2. Each session key is associated with a single message and used only once.

3. The session keys are generated by encompassing an encryption algorithm to generate a new n-bit key from a previous session key and two n/2-bit blocks generated based on user keystrokes, including keystroke timing. The two blocks are encrypted using the encryption algorithm and the previous key, and combined to form the new key.

4. Assuming RSA is used for PGP asymmetric encryption, the keys are generated using large prime numbers such that an odd number n is of sufficient size(>200 bits).

5. The private keys are protected by a passphrase encryption scheme in order to protect the confidentiality of that private key. The security of PGP depends on protecting private keys.
/************************************************************/


/************************************************************/
Lecture 70 (PGP Key Management II)
1. When a user has multiple private/public key pairs, how knows which was used when he receives an encrypted message by generating an ID likely to be unique for a given user.

2. The user’s private-key ring contains: timestamp, key ID, public key, private key (encrypted using a passphrase), and User ID.

3. The user’s public-key ring contains: timestamp, key ID, public key, and user ID.

4. Steps to retrieving a private key from the key ring:
	- Consult the key ID to obtain the private key
	-Supply the passphrase to recover the unencrypted private key
	-Recovers session key and decrypts the message.

5. The key legitimacy field is associated with each public key in the user’s public key ring that indicates the extent to which PGP trusts that this is a valid public key for this user.

6. A key may be revoked by issuing a signed key revocation certificate. Recipients are expected to update their public key rings.

/************************************************************/
Lecture 71 (Availability)
1. The consumer problem involves a situation where the attacker gets logically between the client and service and somehow disrupts the communication. (aka “man-in-the-middle” attack). The producer problem involves a situation where the attacker produces, offers or requests so many services that the server is overwhelmed. The producer problem is more prevalent.

2. Syn flooding occurs in the producer problem such that an attacker forges the return address on a number of SYN packets. The server fills its table with the half-open connections.

3. First three solutions for syn flooding not ideal:
	- Increase the server’s queue size: the attacker can request more pseudo addresses to the server
	- Shorten the time-out period: Slower clients will be at an disadvantage
	- Filter suspicious packets: Hard to determine which packets are legitimate or suspicious.
/************************************************************/


/************************************************************/
Lecture 72 (Availability II)
1. Packet filtering works very well to prevent attacks because it can detect patterns of identifiers in the request stream and block messages in that pattern. More specfically, ingress filtering means sniffing incoming packets and discarding those with source IP addresses outside a given range.

2. An intrusion detection system (IDS) can analyze traffic patterns and react to anomalous patterns. However often there is nothing apparently wrong but the voume of requests. An IDS reacts after the attack has begun. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) attempts to prevent intrusion by more aggressively blocking attempted attacks. This assumes that the attacking traffic can be identified.

3. Four different solutions in DDoS attacks:
	- Over-provisioning the network: monitoring the traffic on the majority of networks. The solution is expensive and unworkable because there are too many servers.
	- Filtering attack packets: Distinguishing the attack packets from regular packets. The solution may be hard to implement because there is no guarantee that the detection will sense malicious packets versus legitimate packets
	- Slow down processing: slow down the process time on servers. Disadvantages all requestors, but perhaps disproportionately disadvantages attackers.
	- “Speak-up” solution (Mike Walfish): request additional traffic from all requestors, assuming that the attacker’s bots are maxed out. This means the solution is able to detect the malicious packets and regular packets because the regular packets are able to send more packets.
/************************************************************/


/************************************************************/
Lecture 73 (Intrusion Detection)
1. False negatives is when a genuine attack is not detected. False positives are harmless behavior that is mis-classified as an attack. False negatives are worse.

2. IDS is accurate if it detects all genuine attacks. IDS is precise if it never reports legitimate behavior as an attack.

3. “It’s easy to build an IDS that is either accurate or precise” means that an IDS system could be designed to detect all possible attacks, or detect no attacks at all.

4. The base rate fallacy is a error in assumption where logic tends to focus on specific information and disregard the overall information it may lead to. It is relevant to IDS because the attributes of the system aim to detect malicious attacks, even if the rate of occurrence is small.

/************************************************************/
Lecture 74 (Anatomy of an Attack: CodeRed)
1. CodeRed version 1 attempted to exploit the vulnerability of inadequate bounds checking on some input buffers that allowed system level execution of code.It also tried to launch a DoS attack on the white house,

2. CodeRed version 1 was ineffective because the worms used a static seed in its random number generator and thus generates identical lists of IP addresses on each infected machine. Each infected machine probed the same list of machines, so the worm spread slowly.

3. When a worm is “memory resident”, it means that the worm only existed when a computer was on; a machine can be disinfected by simply rebooting.

4. CodeRed version 2 was much more effective than version 1 because it used a random seed random number generator instead of a static seed. This means infected additional devices with web interfaces, (routers, switches, DSL modems, and printers).
/************************************************************/


/************************************************************/
Lecture 75 (CodeRed II)
1. CodeRed II is related to CodeRed (v1 and v2) by exploiting the same vulnberability of buffer-overflow in Microsoft’s IIS webservers.

2. CodeRed incorporated its elaborate propagation scheme in order to sustain the worm attack on thousands of computers. The propagation focused primarily on related/connected computers on the same network, such as companies and universities.

3. CodeRed II attempted to install a mechanism for remote, root-level access to the infected machine. This backdoor allows any code to be executed, so the machines could be used as zombies for future attacks.

4. The large population of unpatched machines indicates that we are not careful enough to take precautions in order to prevent malicious hacking by the attackers.

5. Even though there was a patch to prevent the future worm attacks, 9 out of 10 breaches amounted to the users not taking the initiative to protect their machines. The lesson from the study show that more exposure and urgency of the potential dangers of computer attacks needed to be prevalent.
/************************************************************/


/************************************************************/
Lecture 76 (Certification)
1. A certification regime for secure products is necessary and useful because it allows average customers to buy security products that have been evaluated by an expert authority.

2. In the evaluation standard, there needs to be a set of requirements defining security functionality, a set of assurance requirements needed for establishing the functional requirements, a methodology for determining that the functional requirements are met, and a measure of the evaluation result indicating the trustworthiness of the evaluated system.

3. Crypto devices would have a separate evaluation mechanism because there is not a lot of people who have expertise on the cryptography field.This means that data handling is very sensitive.

4. Four levels of certification for crypto devices:
	- Level 1: The lowest level of security. Basic security requirements, including use of at least one Approved algorithm or Approved security function. No specific physical security mechanisms required.
	- Level 2: Improves physical security mechanisms by requiring features that show evidence of tampering, including tamper-evident coatings or seals that must be broken to attain physical access to the plaintext cryptographic keys and critical security parameters (CSPs) within the module, or pick-resistant locks on covers or doors to protect against unauthorized physical access.
	- Level 3: Attempts to deter an intruder gaining access to data. Physical security mechanisms are intended to have a high probability of detecting and responding to attempts at physical access, use or modification of the cryptographic module. E.g., strong enclosures and tamper detection/response circuitry that zeroizes all plaintext data when the removable covers/doors of the cryptographic module are opened.
	- Level 4: Physical security mechanisms provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access. Penetration of the cryptographic module enclosure from any direction has a very high probability of being detected, resulting in the immediate zeroization of all plaintext CSPs.
/************************************************************/


/************************************************************/
Lecture 77 (The Common Criteria)
1. The Common Criteria is a set of requirements for secure systems that have been accepted by most countries. It comprises, CC documents, CC Evaluation Methodology, and country-specific evaluation methodologies called Evaluation Scheme or National Scheme.

2. The Common Criteria is common because the set of security requirements has been accepted by most countries around the world.

3. There would be a need for “National Schemes” because some countries might have stricter government regulations that require security products to have extended review.

4. A protection profile is a description of family of products in terms of threats, environmental issues and assumptions, security objectives, and requirements for the Common Criteria. A security target is a document that contains the security requirements of a product to be evaluated, and specifies the measures offered by the product to meet those requirements. It may match a protection profile. A protection profile is a formal description of security for a class of systems; a security target is a specific system or family of systems.
/************************************************************/


/************************************************************/
Lecture 78 (Protection Profile Example)
1. The overall goal of the protection profile as exemplified by the WBIS example is to highlight the general policies that a specific instance of a class of systems should be able to do. It provides a systematic way of deciding whether threats and assumptions are being addressed by mechanisms and requirements.

2. The purpose of the various parts of the protection profile is that it allows a holistic view of the class of systems to see whether there are potential vulnerabilities associated with a part in the protection profile.

3. The purpose of the matrix on is to have an overall picture of the threats/assumptions against the security objectives and system requirements. If each threat/assumption is resolved by a particular security objective or system requirement, it means that the class of security products are more than likely to be safe and there exists a mechanism or system property that is able to resolve the issue.
/************************************************************/


/************************************************************/
Lecture 79 (Security Target Example)
1. The overall goal of the security target evaluation is to provide implementations specific to a system or class of systems that resolve the issues highlighted by the protection profile. It specifies what security means for this product/class of products and how the product enforces that notion of security.

2. Protection profile evaluation describes the security policies that a category of products or systems should be able to preserve. Security target evaluations describe the implementation of security policies to see if it still preserves goals.
/************************************************************/


/************************************************************/
Lecture 80 (CC Evaluations)
1. EALs are Evaluation Assurance Levels and are designed to indicate that a product  was developed with a certain amount of care to which the evaluation was tested through rigor.

2. The NSA performed CC evaluation for levels 5+ while lower level evaluatations can be performed by certified government agencies such as the NIST.

3. Higher EALs are not necessarily mutually recognized by various countries because the NSA conducts evaluations for those higher levels.

4. Vendors cannot certify their own products because there might be a security issue if vendors self-rate their products but cannot achieve its designed model of security.

5. Reverse engineering a model during a formal evaluation is bad because it suggests that the product being formally evaluated contains some vulnerabilities.
