Lecture 66
==========
1. PGP is a suite of tools for secure email communications which uses strong cryptographic protocols to ensure confidentiality and authenticity of communications.
2. Phil Zimmerman distrusted the government and wanted to provide strong cryptographic tools to large numbers of people.
3. Apparently it provides good security which can resist the efforts of governments and law enforcement.
4. Companies want support for the software.

Lecture 67
==========
1. Authentication: Send a signed hash of the message body together with the message itself. Receiver decrypts the hash and compares to the message body to verify.
2. Confidentiality: Send a symmetric session key encrypted with the receivers public key together with the message body encrypted with the session key. Receiver decrypts the session key with his private key then the message with the session key.
3. Authenticate and then encrypt for confidentiality.

Lecture 68
==========
1. Compression, mail compatibility (ascii encoding), segmentation
2. The security measures shouldn't increase the required bandwidth of communication for communication of the same sets of messages.
3. The signature should depend on the actual message rather than the message and the compression algorithm together.
4. Base64 encoding is needed because mail programs use some non-ascii byte sequences as control characters.
5. Segmentation is needed because mailers only accept fixed sized chunks of text at a time.

Lecture 69
==========
1. Random session keys, public keys, private keys, password-derived keys for encrypting stored keys
2. Session keys must be truly random.
3. Session keys are generated by polling 'sources of entropy' like records of mouse movements to get enough bits for the key size.
4. The number of bits for the key is given by the RSA algorithm. Random bit strings of the appropriate length are generated until a prime is recovered.
5. Private keys are protected by encrypting them with a password-generated key. This is necessary because a physical intrusion would completely compromise the other keys, but the password key need not be stored on disk.


Lecture 70
==========
1. The encrypted message is sent with a key-ID
2. The user's own private and public keys together with the key id, user id, and creation time for each.
3. Public keys, key ids, user ids, and creation time for other users
4. To access a private key, the user must provide a pass phrase to decrypt it.
5. The legitimacy field indicates how much the user trusts the key is good for communication.
6. The revoker sends revocation signatures requesting those who have his key to use a new one.

Lecture 71
==========
1. The consumer problem is about disrupting communications in flight. The producer problem prevents the server from handling valid requests that arrive there. The producer problem is more prevalent.
2. TCP servers receive SYN messages to initiate connections. A SYN flooding attack sends a lot of SYN messages forcing the server to allocate space while waiting for ACKs for SYN/ACKs
3. These measures either make it harder to accept legitimate traffic or don't solve the problem at all.

Lecture 72
==========
1. Packet filtering is expensive to implement over high-volume traffic.
2. Detection activates after the attack has begun, analyses traffic to signal intrusion. Prevention activates before damage has happened, attempting to prevent expected threats.
3. 1. Buy more servers so it's harder to overwhelm the redundant/distributed system -- expensive
   2. Filter out the bad packets -- not always possible
   3. Universally slow down processing -- disadvantages legitimate users as well
   4. Request more traffic, hopefully increasing good/bad traffic ratio -- counterintuitive

Lecture 73
==========
1. - False positives drop packets that should be admitted. This could be bad if there is no corrective measure to allow the packet to *eventually* pass.
   - False negatives allow bad packets that should be dropped. How bad this is depends on the nature of the attack. For a DDOS, it's probably not a big deal if the rate of acceptance is low.
2. Accurate: almost all packets which are bad get filtered. Precise: almost no packets which are good get filtered out.
3. Most accurate: drop all packets! Most precise: accept all packets!
4. The base rate fallacy describes how an apparently 'high' accuracy could mean alerts in the IDS are dominated by false positives because the number of actual attacks is low from the start.

Lecture 74
==========
1. CodeRed 1 used an IIS vulnerability to infect other machines (pseudo)randomly, deface web pages, and DDOS www1.whitehouse.gov
2. The IP addresses the worm chose to infect were the same on every machine and the worm could be destroyed by rebooting the machine it was on.
3. The worm's code stayed in main memory. Rebooting the machine prevents the worm from running upon reboot.
4. Version 2 was more effective because it didn't use the same seed to generate its IP addresses on each machine.

Lecture 75
==========
1. It exploited the *same* vulnerability as the previous 2 and used the code name employed by security researchers.
2. The scheme heavily favors attempts at machines on the same subnet, so they likely have the same configuration. The distribution of access windows (i.e., when IPs of a particular net are probed) still allows for expanding to other subnets.
3. CodeRed II installed back-doors and then remained dormant.
4. Unpatched machines are potential targets for future attacks with new worms. For a large population of such machines, all on the network makes for a formidable botnet.
5. Vulnerabilities are persist not necessarily because they are difficult to fix but because people don't know to or don't bother to patch their machines.

Lecture 76
==========
1. Few people can properly complete an analysis of security software.
2. Components:
   1. A set of requirements for the software itself
   2. A set of requriements for assessing whehter the requirements are met
   3. A way of testing that 2 was done correctly
   4. A way of measuring the results from 2 and 3 to quantify the security requirements of 1.
3. Physical systems have to be evaluated differently to because they are a susceptible to a different set of attacks.
4. The FIPS 140-2 levels requirements scale from the most basic algorithm-level security (1), to basic physical integrity (2), to strong guarantees of confidentiality (3), to government level (4)

Lecture 77
==========
1. The common critera are a set of standards for evaluating and grading security systems
2. The criteria are shared between nations.
3. Each country has its own political and military concerns which necessitate different requirements from the standard.
4. A protection profile is a model or class for security. A security target is an instance of a profile based on present needs.

Lecture 78
==========
1. The goal is that only the machines know what's inside the bins. Only the machines.
2. I. Identify assets (weight/id records) and provide an overview
   II. State some assumptions needed to set up the bin system
   III. Tell you what you have to protect against in this world of tag-smashing lunatics. Another assumption (i.e., truck back-ups) but in III instead of II.
   IV. Say what should happen if the other stuff is taken care of -- if you don't mess everything up
   V. Even more vague statement of requirements in case you didn't understand the other parts of the profile.
3. The matrix provides an overview of which objectives address which threats/concerns.
