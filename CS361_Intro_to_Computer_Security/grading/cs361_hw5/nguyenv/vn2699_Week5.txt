Week 5

****************
** Lecture 66 **
****************
1: Pretty Good Privacy - a strong encryption algorithm that could be used by anyone.
2: Zimmermann did not trust the government and believed that everyone had an absolute right to privacy.
3: Yes.
4: In a commercial enterprise, you would probably want a support line to help in case anything goes wrong so you don't lose business.

****************
** Lecture 67 **
****************
1: The sender creates a message, hashes it, signs the hash with his private key, and sends it along with the unhashed message. The reciever uses the sender's public key to verify the signature and generates a new hash code and compares it with the decrypted hash code.
2: The sender encrypts a message using a random session key K. The message is encrypted with the reciver's public key. Both are sent. The reciever uses his private key to recover the session key and is used to decrypt the message.
3: Apply the authentication step to the original message and then apply the confidentiality step to the resulting message.

****************
** Lecture 68 **
****************
1: Comparess, email compatibility, and segmentation.
2: Compression reduces redundancy in the message, strengthening the encryption.
3: So that the signature doesn't depends on the compression alogithm.
4: Radix-64 converts map groups of three octets into four ASCII characters because many email systems would choek on certain bit strings they'd interpret as control commands.
5: Email systems often restirct message length and longer messages must be broken into segments so PGP automatiaclly segments messages that are too long so the signature and session key appear only once.

****************
** Lecture 69 **
****************
1: Session, public, private, and passphrase-based keys.
2: It is a one-time session symmetric key.
3: It generates a new sesion key by using a previous session key and two n/2-bit blocks generated based on user keystores, including keystroke timing. The two blocks are encrypted using an encryption alogithm and the previous key, and combined to form the new key.
4: For new RSA keys, an odd number n of sufficient size is generated and test for primality. If it is not prime, repeat witht another generate another number until a prime is found.
5: They are protect with a user-supplied passphrase because the security of the system depends on protecting private keys.

****************
** Lecture 70 **
****************
1: PGP uses the lesat significant 64-bits of the key as the ID for public/private key pairs.
2: The timestamp, key ID, public key, private key, and user ID.
3: The timestamp, key ID, public key, and user ID.
4: PGP retrieves the reciever's encrypted private from the private-key ring, using the key ID field in the session key component of the message as index. The user is prompted for the passphrase to recover the unencrypted private key. PGP recovers the session key and decrypts the message.
5: It indicates the extent to which PGP trusts that this is a valid public key for this user.
6: To limit the period of use for the key or is the key is compromised.

****************
** Lecture 71 **
****************
1: In the consumer problem, the attacker gets logically between the client and service and somehows disrupts the communication. In the produer problem, which is more prevalent, the attacker produces, offers, or requests so many services that the server is overwhelmed.
2: A SYN Flooding attack happens when an attacker forges the return address on a number of SYN packets. The server fills its table with half-open connections and all legitimate accesses are deined until the connections time-out.
3: In the first situation, that would consume a large amount of resource and the attack could just simple just send more requests. In the second situation, that would effect legitimate connections. In the third situation, it is very difficult to write an algorithm that could determine if a connection were legitimate or not.

****************
** Lecture 72 **
****************
1: It can detect patterns of identifiers in the request stream and block messages in that pattern.
2: IDS can analyze traffic patterns and react to anomalous patterns. IPS attempts to prevent intrusions by more aggressively blocking attempted attacks. 
3: (1) Over-provisioning the network - have too many servers to be overwhelmed; (2) filtering attack packets - distinguish between attack and legitimate requests; (3) slow down processing - slows processing of all requests; and (4) "speak-up" solution - request additional traffic from all requestors.

****************
** Lecture 73 **
****************
1: In a false negative, a genuine attack is not detect. In a false positive, harmless behavior is mis-classified as an attack. Which is worse depends on context.
2: Accurate means it detects all genuine attacks and precise means it never reports legitimate behavior as an attack.
3: You can either just let every request be reported as an attack or let every request go through.
4: Base rate fallacy mean when presented with general information and specific information, we tend to focus on the general information. In the case of IDS, the chance that a raised alarm is false is very high.

****************
** Lecture 74 **
****************
1: It attempted to perform a DoS on www1.whitehouse.gov.
2: The worm used a static seed so it generated a list of identical IP addresses on each infected machine. Each infected machine probed the same list of machines, so the worm did not spread effectively.
3: A machine can be disinfected by simply rebooting it.
4: It used a random seed generator.

****************
** Lecture 75 **
****************
1: It exploited the same buffer-overflow vulnerability in Microsoft's IIS webservers.
2: So the worm would be more difficult to remove and more effectively propogate onto a greater number of machines.
3: It installs a mechanism for remote, root-level access to the infected machine, allowing any code to be executed so the machines could be used as zombies for future attacks.
4: There are a large number of machines still vulnerable to the same or similar attack.
5: Users need to be more proactive about patching their machines so that they don't become infected.

****************
** Lecture 76 **
****************
1: Most customers don't have the expertise to assess security requirements, identifying products that meet those requirements, or implement the product correctly.
2: The standard provides a set of requirements defining security functionality, a set of assurance requirements needed for establishing the functional requirements, a methodology for determining that the functional requirements are met, and a measure of the evaluation result indicating the trustworthiness of the evaluated system.
3: The government wants to be aware of all encryption alogorithms being used.
4: (1) basic security with at least one approved algorithm or function, (2) improved physical security, tamper-evident packaging, (3) strong tamper-resistance and countermeasures, and (4) complete enelope of protecting including immediate zeroing of keys upon tampering.

****************
** Lecture 77 **
****************
1: The Common Criteria an international criteria for secure systems evalution.
2: Evalutations (to a certain level) by one signing country are respected by all of the others.
3: Additional protection from countries within the Common Criteria.
4: A “protection proﬁle” is a formal descriptions of security for a class of systems and a "security target" is a specfic system or family of systems.

****************
** Lecture 78 **
****************
1: You want protection from the user. You don't want problems surrounding the ID tag - don't want it destroyed by the owner, have the owner send a faulty signal, or false information.
2: It describes what security means for a particular class of systems.
3: It maps threats and assumptions to security objects and requirements as to provides a systematic way of deciding whether threats and assumptions are being addressed by mechanisms and requirements.

****************
** Lecture 79 **
****************
1: You want to protect the user. The users need unguessable passwords, the administrators need to perform as you expect them to, and attacks need to be detected.
2: It depends on who you want protection from and what security means for the particular product.

****************
** Lecture 80 **
****************
1: EALs are evaluation levels used by vendors to provide assurance that the corresponding rigar was applied during development and test.
2: The government of the country where the evalution is performed.
3: Governments may want their own set of security systems for their own use.
4: No because they could just arbitralily give themselves high EAL ratings.
5: It would be a weak security system if anyone could simply reverse engineer the model from code.
