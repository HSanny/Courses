Questions on Review
----------
1. [lec01] Why the anomaly detection is predictive? Is not it unsupervised learning?

2. [lec02] What is Equal interval width discretization method, and what is equal frequency discretization method?

3. [lec05] Pessimistic Estimate? What is Minimum Description Length? How to use it for post-pruning?

4. [lec06] ROC curve? how to use it compare performance of different models?
