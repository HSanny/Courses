\renewcommand{\AA}{\left( \begin{array}{cc}

        \end{array} \right) }
\newcommand{\AAT}{\left( \begin{array}{cc}

\newcommand{\xx}{\left( \begin{array}{c}
            x_{0}  \\ \chi_{1} 
        \end{array} \right)}
\subsection{Show $A_{00}$ is SPD}
\begin{proof}
    Since $A$ is SPD, then
    \begin{align}
        A^T = A \label{sym} \\
        \forall x,\ x^T A x \geq 0 \label{pd}
    \end{align}
    From \eqref{sym}, we have
    \begin{align}
        A^T = \AA^T = \AAT = A
    \end{align}
    Then 
    \begin{align} \label{symx0}
        A_{00}^T = A_{00} \tag{symmetry of A}
    \end{align}
    Also, we denote arbitrary $x = \left( \begin{array}{c}
            x_{0}  \\ \chi_{1} 
        \end{array} \right)$ and then from \eqref{pd}, we have
    \begin{align}
        x^T A x = \xx^T \AA \xx =  x_0^T A_{00} x_0 + 2\chi_1 a_{10}^T
        x_0 + \chi_1^2 \alpha_{11}  > 0,\ \forall x_0, \chi_1
    \end{align}
    Let $\chi_1 = 0$, then we have
    \begin{align} \label{pdx0}
        x_0^T A_{00} x_0  > 0,\ \forall x_0 \tag{positive definiteness}
    \end{align}
    In terms of \eqref{symx0} and \eqref{pdx0}, then it is proved that
    $A_{00}$ is SPD.
\end{proof}
\subsection{$l_{10}^T = a_{10}^T L_{00}^{-T}$ is well defined}
Since $L_{00}$ is non-singular, then it is easy to derive that $L_{00}^T$ is also non-singluar.
Then $L_{00}^{-T}$ exists. Hence,
\begin{align}
    l_{10}^T = a_{10}^T L_{00}^{-T}
\end{align}
is well-defined. 

\subsection{$\alpha_{11} - l_{10}^T l_{10} > 0$}
Let partition arbitrary $x = \xx$, then since $A$ is SPD, we have
\begin{align}
    x^T A x  \nonumber 
    &= \xx^T \AA \xx \nonumber \\
    &= x_{0}^T A_{00} x_{0} + 2 \chi_{1} x_{0}^T a_{10} + \chi_{1} \label{last}
    \alpha_{11} > 0
\end{align}
Now we instantiate $\left( \begin{array}{c}
             -A_{00}^{-1} a_{10}  \\ 1 
        \end{array} \right) $, then from \eqref{last}, we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    & \hspace{1cm} x'^T A x' > 0 \\
    &\Leftrightarrow\hspace{0.4cm} a_{10}^T A_{00}^{-T} A_{00} A_{00}^{-1} a_{10} - 2 a_{10}^T A_{00}^{-T}
    a_{10} + \alpha_{11} > 0 \\
    &\Leftrightarrow\hspace{0.4cm} a_{10}^T A_{00}^{-T} a_{10} - 2 a_{10}^T
    A_{00}^{-T} a_{10} + \alpha_{11} > 0\\
    &\Leftrightarrow\hspace{0.4cm} \alpha_{11} - a_{10}^T A_{00}^{-T} a_{10}
    > 0 \\
    &\Leftrightarrow\hspace{0.4cm} \alpha_{11} - a_{10}^T A_{00}^{-1} a_{10} >
    0\\
    &\Leftrightarrow\hspace{0.4cm} \alpha_{11} - a_{10}^T L_{00}^{-T}
    L_{00}^{-1} a_{10} > 0\\
    &\Leftrightarrow\hspace{0.4cm} \alpha_{11} - l_{10}^T l_{10} > 0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Show equality}
\newcommand{\LL}{\left( \begin{array}{cc}
            L_{00} & l_{10}  \\
            l_{10}^T & \lambda_{11} 
        \end{array} \right) }
\begin{align}
   L\cdot L^T =  \LL \LL^T = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
            L_{00} L_{00}^T & L_{00} l_{10}  \\
            l_{10}^T L_{00}^T & l_{10}^T l_{10} + \lambda_{11}^2
        \end{array} \right) 
\end{align} 
Obviously, $L \cdot L^T = A$ if only if 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    A_{00} &= L_{00} L_{00}^T \\
    a_{10} &= L_{00} l_{10} \\
    \alpha_{11} &= L_{10}^T l_{10} + \lambda_{11} ^2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\section{}
\subsection{Another proof of Cholesky Factorization Theorem}
Proof by induction.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Base Case}: $n = 1$. Obviously, $A = L_{00} L_{00}^T$ holds. Say,
    $A = \alpha_{11}$. In this case, we have $L_{00} = \sqrt{\alpha_{11}}$. 
    \item \textbf{Inductive Cases}: Assume the result is true for SPD matrix $A
    \in \mathbb{R}^{(n-1)\times (n-1)}$. We will show that it holds for $A\in
    \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. Partition $A$ and $L$ as indicated on the
    instruction. Let 
    \begin{align} 
        l_{10}^T &= a_{10}^T \cdot L_{00}^{-T} \\
        \lambda_{11} &= \sqrt{\alpha_{11} - l_{10}^T l_{10}} 
    \end{align}
    Then $L$ is the desired Cholesky factor of $L$, that is, $A = L L^T$.
\item By the principle of mathematical induction, the theorem holds.
\end{itemize}

\section{Cost of Bordered Algorithm}
At the iteration $i$, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a10t$ update: $i^2$ (multiplication)
    \item $\alpha11$ udpate: $i$ (subtraction) + $i$ (dot product) 
\end{itemize}
\begin{align}
    \text{ total cost } = \sum_{i = 1}^n (i^2 + 2i) = \frac{1}{3} n^3 + n^2
    \approxeq \frac{1}{3} n^3

\section{$LDL^T$ Factorization for tridiagonal matrices}
\textbf{Codes}:
\lstinputlisting{../FLAME@lab/LDL_TRI_unb.m}

\noindent
\textbf{Costs}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Divide: $ 1 \cdot n = n$ (l21 update)  
    \item Multiply: $1 \cdot n = n$ (alpha22 update)
    \item Add/Subtract: $1 \cdot n = n$ (alpha21 update) 
\end{itemize}
In terms of above analysis, the approximate cost is $\BigO{n}$. \vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
\textbf{Analytics}: 
    The way I come up with this algorithm is to instantiate the $LDL^T$
    factorization in last question to the case of tridiagonal matrices. That
    is, treat the $alpha21$ and $l21$ as vectors with only one non-zero entry.

For $LDL^T$ factorization, we have 
\begin{align}
    A &= L D L^T \nonumber \\
    &= \LLL \DDD \LLL^T  \nonumber \\
    &= \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
            L_{00} D_{00} L_{00}^T & \lambda_{10} L_{00} D_{00} e_L & 0 \\

        L_{22} D_{22} L_{22}^T \\
    \end{array} \right) \\
    & = \AAA
\end{align}
And by matching, we have 
\begin{equation} \label{111}
    \begin{aligned}
    A_{00}  &= L_{00} D_{00} L_{00}^T  \\
   \alpha_{10} e_L  &= \lambda_{10} L_{00} D_{00} e_L \\

    A_{22} &= \lambda_{21}^2 \delta_1 e_F e_F^T + L_{22} D_{22} L_{22}^T
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Similarly, for $UEU^T$ factorization, we have
\begin{align}
    A &= U E U^T \nonumber \\
      &= \UUU \EEE \UUU^T  \nonumber\\
      &= \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
              U_{00} E_{00} U_{00}^T + v_{01} \epsilon_{1} e_L e_L^T & v_{01} \epsilon_1 e_L & 0 \\
              v_{01} \epsilon_1 e_L^T & v_{21}^2 e_F^T E_{22} e_F + \epsilon_1 
        & v_{21} e_F^T E_{22} U_{22}^T \\
        0 & v_{21} U_{22} E_{22} e_F & U_{22} E_{22} U_{22}^T
    \end{array} \right) \\
    &= \AAA
\end{align}
And by matching, we have 
\begin{equation} \label{222}
    \begin{aligned}
    A_{00}  &= U_{00} E_{00} U_{00}^T + v_{01} \epsilon_{1} e_L e_L^T  \\
    \alpha_{10}  &= v_{01} \epsilon_1   \\
    \alpha_{11} &= v_{21}^2 e_F^T E_{22} e_F + \epsilon_1 \\
    \alpha_{21} e_F^T &= v_{21} e_F^T E_{22} U_{22}^T \\
    A_{22} &= U_{22} E_{22} U_{22}^T
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Now we consider the Twisted Factorization
\begin{align}
    & \hspace{0.5cm} \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
        L_{00} & 0 & 0 \\
        \lambda_{10} e_L^T & 1 & v_{21} e_F^T \\
        0 & 0 & U_{22}
    \end{array} \right)
   \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
        D_{00} & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & \phi_1 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & D_{22}
    \end{array} \right) 
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
        L_{00} & 0 & 0 \\
        \lambda_{10} e_L^T & 1 & v_{21} e_F^T \\
        0 & 0 & U_{22}
    \end{array} \right)^T \\
 &= 
 \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
         L_{00} D_{00} L_{00}^T & \lambda_{10} L_{00} D_{00} e_L & 0 \\
        \lambda_{10} e_L^T D_{00} L_{00}^T & \phi_1 + \lambda_{10}^2 e_L^T D_{00} e_L + v_{21}^2 e_F^T E_{22} e_F & v_{21} e_F^T E_{22} U_{22}^T \\
        0 & v_{21} U_{22} E_{22} e_F & U_{22} E_{22} U_{22}^T 
    \end{array} \right) \\
  &= \AAA
\end{align}
Then we have
\begin{align} \label{333}
    \alpha_{11} = \phi_1 + \lambda_{10}^2 e_L^T D_{00} e_L + v_{21}^2 e_F^T E_{22} e_F 
\end{align}
To satisfy \eqref{111}, \eqref{222} and \eqref{333} at the same time, we need to have 
\begin{align}
    \phi_1 = \frac{\delta_1 + \epsilon_1 - \lambda_{10}^2 e_L^T D_{00} e_L - v_{21}^2 e_F^T E_{22} e_F }{2}
\end{align}

\noindent
\textbf{Complexity}: 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item computation of $e_L^T D_{00} e_L$ or $e_F^T E_{22} e_F$ is
        $\BigO{1}$. (constant time)
    \item computation of the factorized matrix, it requires $\BigO{n}$ for
         assembling components of $U$ and $L$ so as to derive the resulted matrix.

\newcommand{\zerovec}{\left( \begin{array}{c}

Separate terms of the known condition as follows:
\begin{align}
    \underbrace{\LLL \DDD}_{S} \underbrace{\LLL^T \xxx}_y = \zerovec
\end{align}
Then we derive the form of $S$
\begin{align}
   S \triangleq \LLL \cdot \DDD = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
            L_{00} D_{00} & 0 & 0 \\
            \lambda_{10} e_L^T D_{00} & 0 & v_{21} e_F^T E_{22} \\
            0 & 0 & U_{22} E_{22} \end{array} \right)
\end{align}
Then relate it to $y$
\begin{align} \label{444}
    S \cdot y = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
            L_{00} D_{00} & 0 & 0 \\
            \lambda_{10} e_L^T D_{00} & 0 & v_{21} e_F^T E_{22} \\
            0 & 0 & U_{22} E_{22} \end{array} \right) \yyy = \zerovec
\end{align}
where 
\begin{equation} \label{555}
    \begin{aligned}
    L_{00}^T x_{0} + \lambda_{10} e_L \chi_1 &= y_0 \\
    \chi_1 &= \psi_1  \\
    v_{21}\chi_1 e_F + U_{22}^T x_{2} &= y_2
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Solve \eqref{444}, we have
\begin{equation} 
    \begin{aligned}
    y_0 &= 0 \\
    \psi_1 &= c \text{ (constant) } \\
    y_2 &= 0
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
In terms of \eqref{555}, for the vector $x$, we need to solve the following system
\begin{equation} 
    \begin{aligned}
    L_{00}^T x_{0} + \lambda_{10} e_L \chi_1 &= 0 \\
    \chi_1 &= c  \\
    v_{21}\chi_1 e_F + U_{22}^T x_{2} &= 0
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Note that this equation system has infinity number of solutions unless we set
$c$ fixed. Here, we set $c = 1$ for simplicity. Then
\begin{align}
    L_{00}^T x_{0} &= - \lambda_{10} e_L   \\
    U_{22}^T x_{2} &= - v_{21} e_F 
\end{align}
which is actually two gaussian elimination problem. In terms of the special
structure of $L_{00}$ and $U_{22}$, the solution takes complexity $\BigO{n^2}$.
