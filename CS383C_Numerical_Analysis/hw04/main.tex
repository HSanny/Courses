\section{}
Show that, for {\it a consistent matrix norm}, $\kappa(A) \geq 1$.

\begin{proof}
\begin{align}
    \kappa(A) = ||A|| \cdot ||A^{-1}|| \geq || A A^{-1}|| = ||I|| = 1
\end{align}
Note that the above $||\cdot||$ was for arbitrary induced matrix norm.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    For arbitrary matrix $A$ and $B$, $|| AB || \leq || A || \cdot || B ||$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{align}
        || A B || = \sup_{x \not =0} \frac{|| A B x ||}{|| x ||} 
        &= \sup_{x \not =0} \frac{|| A (B x) ||}{|| x ||} \\ 
        &\leq \sup_{x \not =0} \frac{|| A || \cdot || B x ||}{|| x ||} \\
        &\leq \sup_{x \not =0} \frac{|| A || \cdot || B || \cdot || x || }{|| x ||} \\
        &= || A || \cdot || B || 
\end{align}
Hence, it is concluded that $|| A B || \leq || A || \cdot || B ||$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    For abitrary norm $|| \cdot ||$ and identity matrix I,\ $|| I || = 1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{align}
        || I || = \sup_{x\not =0} \frac{|| I \cdot x ||}{|| x ||} 
        = \sup_{x\not =0} \frac{|| x ||}{|| x ||} 
        = 1
    \end{align}
\end{proof}

If $A$ has lineraly independent columns, show that 
$|| (A^H A)^{-1} A^H ||_2 = \frac{1}{\sigma_{n-1}}$, where $\sigma_{n-1}$
equals {\it the smallest sigular value} of $A$. 

\begin{proof}
    Let $U$, $\Sigma$ and $V$ be singular value decomposition of $A$, such
    that $A = U\Sigma V^H$.

    \begin{align}
         || (A^H A)^{-1} A^H ||_2 
        &= || \big( (U\Sigma V^H)^H U\Sigma V^H \big)^{-1} (U\Sigma V^H)^H ||_2 \\
        &= || \big( V \Sigma^H U^H U\Sigma V^H \big)^{-1} V \Sigma^H U^H ||_2 \\
        &= || \big( V \Sigma^H \Sigma V^H \big)^{-1} V \Sigma^H U^H ||_2 \\
        &= || V^{-H} \Sigma^{-1} \Sigma^{-H} V^{-1}  V \Sigma^H U^H ||_2 \\
        &= || V^{-H} \Sigma^{-1} \Sigma^{-H} \Sigma^H U^H ||_2 \\
        &= || V^{-H} \Sigma^{-1} U^H ||_2 \\
        &= || V \Sigma^{-1} U^H ||_2 \\
        &= || \Sigma^{-1}||_2 \\
        &= \frac{1}{\sigma_{n-1}}
    \end{align}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    (Unitary Invariance) For arbitrary unitary matrix $U$, 
    \begin{align}
        || U A ||_2 = || A U ||_2 = || A ||_2 
    \end{align}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
    For arbitrary diagonal matrix $\Sigma$, 
    \begin{align}
        || \Sigma^{-1} ||_2 = \frac{1}{\sigma_{n-1}}
    \end{align}
    where, $\sigma_{n-1}$ is the least entry of $\Sigma$. 
\end{lemma}
Note that above two lemmas have been proven in exercises of previou notes.

Let $A$ have linearly independent columns. Show that $\kappa_2 (A^H A) =
\kappa_2 (A)^2$ .
\begin{proof}
    We achieve the proof by employing SVD over $A$. Let unitary matrix $U$,
    diagonal matrix $\Sigma$ and unitary matrix $V$ be singular value
    decomposition of $A$, such that $A = U \Sigma V^H$. We start from the
    definition of condition number $\kappa_2 (\cdot)$. 
    \begin{align}
        \kappa_2 (A^H A) &= || A^H A ||_2 \cdot || (A^H A)^{-1} ||_2 
    \end{align}
    Then we discuss the term $|| A^H A ||_2$ and $|| (A^H A)^{-1} ||_2$ respectively.
    \begin{align}
        || A^H A ||_2 
        &=  || (U \Sigma V^H)^H U \Sigma V^H ||_2 \\
        &=  || V \Sigma^H U^H U \Sigma V^H ||_2 \\
        &=  || V \Sigma^H \Sigma V^H ||_2 \\
        &=  || \Sigma^H \Sigma ||_2 \\
        &=  \sigma^2_0 \\
        &= || A ||_2^2
    \end{align}
    Note that $\sigma_0$ is the largest singular value of matrix $A$ and also
    the largest entry of $\Sigma$.
 \begin{align}
     || (A^H A)^{-1} ||_2 
     &=  || \big( (U \Sigma V^H)^H U \Sigma V^H \big)^{-1} ||_2 \\
     &=  || \big( V \Sigma^H U^H U \Sigma V^H \big)^{-1} ||_2 \\
     &=  || \big( V \Sigma^H \Sigma V^H \big)^{-1} ||_2 \\
     &=  || V^{-H} \Sigma^{-1} \Sigma^{-H} V^{-1}  ||_2 \\
     &=  || \Sigma^{-1} \Sigma^{-H} ||_2 \\
     &=  || \Sigma^{-1} \Sigma^{-1} ||_2 \\
     &=  \frac{1}{\sigma_{n-1}^2} \\
     &= || A^{-1} ||_2^2
    \end{align}   
    Now we have 
    \begin{align}
        || A^H A ||_2 &= || A ||_2^2 \\
     || (A^H A)^{-1} ||_2 &= || A^{-1} ||_2^2
    \end{align}
    Then
    \begin{align}
        \kappa_2 (A^H A) &= || A^H A ||_2 \cdot || (A^H A)^{-1} ||_2  \\
        & = || A ||_2^2 \cdot || A^{-1} ||_2^2 \\
        & = \big( || A ||_2 \cdot || A^{-1} ||_2 \big)^2 \\
        & = \kappa_2(A)^2
    \end{align}
    Hence, it can be concluded that 
    \begin{align}
        \kappa_2 (A^H A) & = \kappa_2(A)^2
    \end{align}
\end{proof}

Let $U \in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ be unitary. Show that $\kappa_2(U) = 1$.
\begin{proof}
    \begin{align}
        \kappa_2 (U) &= || U ||_2 || U^{-1} ||_2  \\
        & = \sup_{x\not = 0} \frac{|| U x ||_2}{|| x ||_2} \cdot
        \sup_{y\not = 0} \frac{|| U^{-1} y ||_2}{|| y ||_2} \\
        & = \sup_{x\not = 0} \frac{|| x ||_2}{|| x ||_2} \cdot
        \sup_{y\not = 0} \frac{|| y ||_2}{|| y ||_2} \\
        & = 1 \cdot 1 \\
        & = 1
    \end{align}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    For arbitrary unitary matrix $U$, its inverse $U^{-1}$ is still unitary. 
\end{lemma}
