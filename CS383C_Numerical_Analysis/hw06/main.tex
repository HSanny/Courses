Show that 
\begin{align}
    \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
            I_k & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & -l_{21} & I
        \end{array} \right)^{-1}
    =
    \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
            I_k & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & l_{21} & I
        \end{array} \right)
\end{align}

\begin{proof}
    To show the inverse relation between two matrices, we multiply two matrices 
    \begin{align}
        \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
            I_k & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & -l_{21} & I
        \end{array} \right)
    \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
            I_k & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & l_{21} & I
        \end{array} \right)
    = 
    \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
            I_k & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & -l_{21} + l_{21} & I 
        \end{array} \right)
    = I
    \end{align}
    Then it is proved that 
\begin{align}
    \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
            I_k & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & -l_{21} & I
        \end{array} \right)^{-1}
    =
    \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
            I_k & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline 0 & l_{21} & I
        \end{array} \right)
\end{align}
\end{proof}

\section{}
Assume that 
$ \Lt_{k-1} = 
       \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
               L_{00} & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 
               l_{10}^T & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
               L_{20} & 0 & I
        \end{array} \right)
$
, show that 
$ \Lt_{k} = 
       \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
               L_{00} & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 
               l_{10}^T & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
               L_{20} & l_{21} & I
        \end{array} \right)
$.

\begin{proof}
    It is known that 
    \begin{align}
        L_k = \hat{L}_{k}^{-1} = 
       \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
               I & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 
               0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
               0 & -l_{21} & I
           \end{array} \right)^{-1}
       =
       \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
               I & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 
               0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
               0 & l_{21} & I
           \end{array} \right)
    \end{align}
    Then we have
    \begin{align} 
        \Lt_k = \Lt_{k-1} L_k  
        =  
        \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
               L_{00} & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 
               l_{10}^T & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
               L_{20} & 0 & I
        \end{array} \right)
        \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
               I & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 
               0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
               0 & l_{21} & I
           \end{array} \right)
       =  
       \left( \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
               L_{00} & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 
               l_{10}^T & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
               L_{20} & l_{21} & I
        \end{array} \right)
    \end{align}
    which tells us that $\Lt_k$ can be computed by simply placing computed
    vector $l_{21}$ below the diagonal of a unit lower triangular matrix.
\end{proof}
