1. It looks interesting to use deep learning for sentiment analysis. But one
concern is how to recover or interpret the result derived by deep learning
approach for sentiment analysis. It will be challenging to extract
human-readable information from the nonlinear feature map (the extracted
feature from auto-encoder). For example, there may be certain sentiment that
is combined of thousands of basic emotional elements. It can be easily
detected by RBM but how to nominally refer to it in human language?





2. It is mentioned in the paper that domain adaptation considers the setting
in which the training and testing data are sampled from different
distributions. It looks that it employed tranfer learning to recognize
characteristics of persons from different distributions. Is this correct?
