1. SOM looks decent for the bag-of-words model. There is a another
representation for documents, which employ each paragraph as a basic unit.
(rather than word in the conventional bag-of-words model). What if we use
Self-organizing maps to process document collections that are represented as
Paragraph Vector? Will SOM be weak in this PV representation, (e.g. weak
accuracy or computational complexity)? 




2. It looks that SOM works well for large documents. But how about small
documents and each documents has limited number of distinct words and topics.
(e.g. short newspapers and tales.) Does SOM still work well in this case?
