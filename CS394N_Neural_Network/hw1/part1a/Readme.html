<h2>Part 1a Readme</h2>

<p>
In this part of the homework, all you really have to do is run the X
version of the self-organizing feature map (xsofm) multiple times with
different simulation files that specify increasingly large networks.

<p>
A pre-compiled binary (xsofm) is available for the public Linux machines.
If you are not using the Linux version, just substitute
the name of the binary for your version in what follows, wherever you
see "xsofm".   For a list of the Linux machines available for remote 
login, type "cshosts publinux" at any UTCS machine prompt.

<h3>Sample session:</h3>

<ol>
<li> If you are sitting at a machine for which a native version of xsofm
   is available (i.e. a publinux machine), skip to the next step.  
   Otherwise, from a machine running X-Windows, log in remotely to one of 
   the supported machines and set your display to be your local machine 
   (as described below under <a href="#x-version">"Running X-version"</a>).  

<li> As also described in "Running X-version:" below, define the X 
   resources by setting XENVIRONMENT (<b>very important!</b>).

<li> Prepare your simulation file using <tt>1dsimu</tt> as the starting point: 
  <ul>
   <li> Remove everything below the snapshot definitions (see <a href="#sample_files">below</a>).
   <li> Set the network size (the nx parameter) to something small (e.g. 5).
   <li> Change the tend parameter to however many epochs you want to train.
   <li> Change the snapshot definition so that it will match tend
        (so that the last snapshot will be saved to disk).
  </ul>

<li> Run <tt>xsofm</tt>. A bunch of windows will pop up: 
   <a href="images/input.gif">input</a>, 
   <a href="images/map.gif">network activity</a>, 
   <a href="images/net.gif">network structure</a>, and a 
   <a href="images/netSim.gif">command window</a>.  If you get a lot of error 
   messages saying "Color NNN not allocated", then quit, exit Netscape and 
   other programs that may be hogging colors and start xsofm again.

<li> In the command window, press FILE, specify your simulation file, press RESTART,
   sit back, and watch the show.

<li> After the training is done, repeat steps 3-5 with increasing network
   sizes, say 5-100 units. If you make the net larger, you will have to
   adjust the neighborhood sizes nc in the phase definitions. The initial
   neighborhood radius should be at least 20% of nx, otherwise the
   network may not self-organize. Currently the largest netsize is
   100000; if you want to try larger nets, you have to change maxnx in
   sofmdefs.h and recompile.
</ol>

<a name="x-version"><h3>Running the X-Version:</h3></a>

<p>
If you're running xsofm locally, either from a UTCS machine or your own
box, simply follow the directions below.  To run xsofm remotely, you'll
need to log in via SSH to one of the <a href="http://apps.cs.utexas.edu/unixlabstatus/">UTCS linux machines</a>.
You must enable <i>X11 forwarding</i> on your SSH client.  Linux and Mac users
can do this by running <tt>ssh</tt> with the <tt>-X</tt> flag.

<p>
Procedure:
<ol>
 <li> On the UTCS machines do<blockquote><tt>setenv XENVIRONMENT /u/www/users/risto/cs394n/private/hw1/part1a/XFmrevised</tt></blockquote>
   or in the <B><tt>hw1/part1a</tt></B> directory on your own Linux machine do <blockquote><tt>setenv XENVIRONMENT `pwd`/XFmrevised</tt> </blockquote>
   (for bash, ksh, or zsh), <blockquote><tt>export XENVIRONMENT=/u/www/users/risto/cs394n/private/hw1/part1a/XFmrevised</tt></blockquote>
   (or in the <B><tt>hw1/part1a</tt></B> directory on your own Linux machine) <blockquote><tt>export XENVIRONMENT=`pwd`/XFmrevised</tt> </blockquote>.
   This allows the X-Program to use  XFmrevised as the resource file. If you
   do not set up the X environment,  most of your windows will initially appear
   as the minimum size permitted  by your window manager (possibly just tiny
   little dots!), and these will  have to be resized before you will be able
   to see anything.  
 <li> Type <tt>./xsofm</tt>.
</ol>


<h3>Running the Batch Version:</h3>

<p>
Give the simulation file name as the parameter, e.g.: sofm 1dsimu

<a name="sample_files"><h3>Sample files:</h3>

<p>
<a href="1dsimu">1dsimu</a> is the sample simulation file. The 
<a href="Readme.parameters">Readme.parameters</a> file explains how it is 
set up. In the 1dsimu file, you will find a long list of numbers after the 
parameter list. These are the weights saved during the simulation. You may 
run xsofm and see how they look. To start the simulation from scratch, you 
must delete everything after the snapshots line.  For example in the 1dsimu 
file, delete everything after the line:
<tt>3000 999999999 ;;; snapshots (epoch):0=initial, 9x9=last</tt>

<h3>Changing parameters:</h3>

<p>
The program does not allow online changing of parameters at present,
but this feature may be added in future versions. Currently for each
simulation, you need to create a new copy of the simulation file with
the new parameters.

<p>
<a name="details">Here</a> are more details about the program if you are interested:

<hr>
<h4>Files:</h4>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="XFmrevised">XFmrevised:</a> Application resource file 
       for the X-program.
  <li> <a href="main.c">main.c:</a> The main SOFM code.
  <li> <a href="geninp.c">geninp.c:</a> Generates uniformly distributed 
       input vectors for SOFM.
  <li> <a href="xdisplay.c">xdisplay.c:</a> X-Window graphics initialization.
  <li> <a href="xdraw.c">xdraw.c:</a> X-Window graphics drawing routines.
  <li> <a href="sofmdefs.h">sofmdefs.h:</a> The header file for all *.c files.
  <li> <a href="makefile">makefile:</a> Compiling directives and instructions.
</ul>

<p>
We have supplied a pre-compiled binaries for the public UTCS Linux machines (Ubuntu 12.04).  
This binary requires the Motif shared libraries (libXm.so.2) to be present 
(and in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH) on the machine where they are run. 
You will have to
obtain that library somehow if you want to run the program on a .csres
or telesys machine running Linux.  The xsofm program should also compile 
on other machines with Motif, such as the UTCS SparcStations.

<h3>Compiling:</h3>

<p>
You shouldn't have to compile the program, but if you want to run it on
an unsupported platform, or a different version of Ubuntu, follow these directions.
To get the X-Windows version, type <tt>make xsofm</tt>. To get the batch
version, type <tt>make sofm</tt>. No changes are required to the makefile 
for the UTCS machines, but for others you may need to change the include
file paths and library paths.  Note that the Motif and X Toolkit Intrinsics 
header files and libraries are required for compilation, and these might not be
available on all machines, e.g. Linux boxes at home or on csres (<tt>libxt-dev</tt>, <tt>libmotif-dev</tt> on ubuntu).

<p>
If you have long simulations to run, you might want to change the
compile flag in the makefile from -g to -O. -O optimizes the code, and
makes the program run twice as fast. (The -g flag is to let you debug
the code with a standard debugger like xdbx or gdbx or dbx).

<p>
Why the batch code? Because it runs much faster than the interactive one,
and because you can leave it running in the background if necessary.
