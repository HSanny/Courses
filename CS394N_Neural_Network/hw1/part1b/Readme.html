<h2>Part 1b Readme</h2>

<p>
In this part of the homework, all you really have to do is run the
X-version of the program a couple of times with different parameters
until you find one that results in a good mapping. Sample session:

<ol>
<li> Log in on a Linux machine, if necessary, and set your display as 
  in part Ia.  

<li> For this part, the <tt>XENVIRONMENT</tt> should be set to point 
   to the resources file in the part1b directory instead:
   <tt>export XENVIRONMENT=/u/www/users/risto/cs394n/private/hw1/part1b/XFmrevised</tt> OR from the hw1/part1b directory on your machine <tt>export XENVIRONMENT=`pwd`/XFmrevised</tt>

<li> Prepare your simulation file using <tt>2dsimu</tt> as the starting point: 
  <ul>
   <li> Remove everything below the snapshot definitions (as in part1a).
   <li> Change the network sizes (the nx and ny parameters), the
       learning rates and neighborhoods (see <a href="Readme.parameters">
       Readme.parameters</a> for details) as necessary to get a good mapping.
   <li> Change the tend parameter to however many epochs you want to train.
       At first it is a good idea to run it only for a few hundred
       epochs to get an idea how it is going to organize; after you are
       confident that the parameters are correct, you can run several thousand
       epochs in the background (see part1a <a href="../part1a/Readme.html">
       Readme</a> for details).	
   <li> Change the snapshot definition so that it will match tend
       (so that the last snapshot will be saved).
  </ul>

<li> Run <tt>xsofm</tt>.  The same set of windows as in the previous part 
   should pop up:  <a href="images/input.gif">input</a>, 
   <a href="images/map.gif">network activity</a>, 
   <a href="images/net.gif">network structure</a>, and a 
   <a href="images/netSim.gif">command window</a>,
   although this time the network activity window should be square since the 
   network is two-dimensional.

<li> In the command window, press FILE, specify your simulation file, press RESTART,
   sit back, and watch the show.
<li> If the network does not look good, repeat steps 3-5 with different
   parameters until you are happy with it. Note that currently the
   largest netsize is 1000x1000; if you want to try larger nets, you have to
   change maxnx and maxny in <a href="sofmdefs.h">sofmdefs.h</a> and 
   recompile. 
</ol>

<p>
For more details, see the <a href="../part1a/Readme.html#detail">
More details</a> section of the README for part 1a, noting that the 
<tt>2dsimu</tt> file should be used throughout instead of the <tt>1dsimu</tt>
file.
