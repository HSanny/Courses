<p>Listed below are the frequently asked questions for homework assignment 2

<p><b>Q</b>.&nbsp; Where is the homework directory?<br>
<b>A</b>.&nbsp; It's located at <tt>/u/www/users/risto/cs394n/private/hw2</tt>.
You should copy its contents into a local directory.</p> 


<p><b>Q</b>.&nbsp; Can I run Emergent on my own machine?<br>
<b>A</b>.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Emergent can be installed on various platforms, including 
certain UNIX systems, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OSX.&nbsp; See the official
<a href="https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Main_Page">Emergent</a> website for details.</p>



<p><b>Q</b>. How well should we train our network?<br>
   <b>A</b>. The percentage of correctly recognized examples has little to do
   with your grade.  Do your best until you can't get improvements, then try to
   think why there's a limit and how you would break it.  (Be creative!)
   Include your thoughts in your report, as these discussion are way more
   important than tweaking a network.
