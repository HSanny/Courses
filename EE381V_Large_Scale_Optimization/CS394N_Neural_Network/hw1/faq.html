<h1> Homework 1 FAQ </h1>
<h2>Parts 1a and 1b </h2>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What are we supposed to get for Part 1a? <br>
  <strong> A.</strong> You are supposed to tune the parameters to generate a
  nice Peano&rsquo;s curve, that is, a smooth curve that covers the square as
  much as possible without intersecting itself. </p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What are we supposed to get for Part 1b? <br>
  <strong> A.</strong> You are supposed to tune the parameters to generate a
  nice rectangular mesh whose density reflects the underlying probability distribution. </p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> For Part 1b, instead of a nice rectangular, planar mapping,
    sometimes I end up with something that looks like an hourglass. What&rsquo;s
  going on?<br>
  <strong> A.</strong> This is an example of local minima at work; from certain
      initial states, the network finds the best solution it can, even though
      it is not a good global solution. If you think about it a little while,
      you should be able to imagine how it happens. Changing just about any of
      the parameters (e.g. the random seed value) and restarting will usually
      fix the problem. If it happens repeatedly for a given network configuration
      there may be a parameter that is not set in the proper range. </p>
<h2>Parts 3a and 3b</h2>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> For Parts 3a and 3b, what do the digits in the squares
  mean? <br>
  <strong>A.</strong> This is described in <a href="part3a/Readme.html">Part
3a Readme</a>, Item 3. Each square represents a unit in the
map. If a square has a digit, say 3, at its center, it means that the
corresponding map unit has become the winner for some (or all) training examples
that are the handwritings of 3. In short, the unit recognizes 3. During testing,
if the unit is a winner for anything other than what it was trained to recognize&mdash;say
5, that means it fails the test, and the incorrectly recognized digit 5
appears in the square at a position other than the center.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> For Parts 3a and 3b, does the colors of the digits in
    the map mean anything? <br>
  <strong> A.</strong> Not really. The coloring is primarily for your visual
convenience. </p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> There are a lot of empty squares. Why? <br>
  <strong>A.</strong> An empty square represents a map unit that, for every input
pattern, it not the maximally responding unit (winner). </p>
<h2>General Usage of <tt>sofm</tt> and <tt>xsofm</tt></h2>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why does my <tt>xsofm</tt> program come up with just a
  command window, and crash when I try to run something? <br> 
  <strong>A.</strong> Possibly because you did not set the environment variable
  for the resource file. Make sure you use the full pathname to <tt>XFmrevised</tt>,
  like this:</p> 
<blockquote><tt>setenv XENVIRONMENT /u/www/users/risto/cs394n/private/hw1/part1a/XFmrevised</tt></blockquote> 
<p>Of course, you could also copy <tt>XFmrevised</tt> to your directory, and
  just say </p> 
<blockquote><tt>setenv XENVIRONMENT ./XFmrevised</tt></blockquote> 
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Does it make a difference which machine I am using?<br> 
  <strong> A.</strong> You can run sofm anywhere, but you need an X-display to
  see the graphics with <tt>xsofm</tt>. They show up best on color monitors.
  Make sure you do the usual <tt>xhost+</tt> on the local machine, and <tt>setenv
  DISPLAY</tt> on the machine you are running it on, if you are not on a <tt>.cs.utexas.edu</tt> machine.</p> 
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Does it make a difference which version of <tt>sofm</tt> or <tt>xsofm</tt> I
  use for each part?<br> 
  <strong>A.</strong> Yes! The subdirectory for each part has a <em>different</em> program
  with the same name, e.g. <tt>part1a/xsofm</tt> and <tt>part1b/xsofm</tt>. There
  are important differences between each of these files, even though they are
  very similar. For instance, the one in Part 1a has special code to generate
  a uniform input distribution, while that in Part 1b has special code to generate
  a non-uniform input distribution. Be sure to use the ones provided in the appropriate
  directory for each part. </p> 
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why does <tt>xsofm</tt> say &ldquo;color xxx not allocated?&rdquo; What
  can be done to fix it?<br> 
  <strong>A.</strong> This happens because other applications on your screen
  have already allocated some of the colors that <tt>xsofm</tt> is trying to
  use. When too many colors are not allocated, the display of activation patterns
  won&rsquo;t appear well. The input display and the network weights display
will still work fine. You can either</p>
<ul> 
  <li>ignore this problem, and just look at the input display and network displays;</li> 
  <li> kill off some of your applications and rerun <tt>xsofm</tt>;</li> 
  <li> migrate to a machine with more colors (if you insist on seeing fancy stuff);
    or</li> 
  <li> go and reduce the colors <tt>xsofm</tt> is trying to allocate. To reduce
    allocated colors, you have to go into the <tt>create_colormap</tt> routine
    in <tt>xdisplay.c</tt>, reduce the value of <tt>color_range</tt>, and recompile
    the program. </li> 
</ul> 

<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why do the <tt>xsofm</tt> windows appear different sizes on different
  displays?<br>
  <strong> A.</strong> The resolution of the different monitors are different.
  The size of the windows is set in the application resource file&mdash;it is set
  for a minimum 1024x768 screen. To run on other machines, and see all of the
  windows properly, you can either (1) change these sizes in <tt>XFmrevised</tt> or (2)
  just resize the windows after the program has come up. Note that the activity
  window will sometimes have black artifacts if it is not an integer multiple
  of the network size. </p> 
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Once the simulation is running, how do I control it?<br>
  <strong>A.</strong> <tt>sofm</tt> is not an interactive
  program, only <tt>xsofm</tt> is. When you are displaying previously stored snapshots,
  it will wait for a buttonpress before displaying the next snapshot (similarly
  with <tt>sofm</tt>, when you are displaying multiple snapshots, hit a return to see
  the next one). All simulation parameters are specified in the simufile. The
  file <tt>README.parameters</tt> explains how they work. The reason for making these
  programs batch-oriented rather than interactive is that most of the big simulations
  take hours, or days (sometimes months!), so you really want to run them in
  the background and only periodically check how they are doing. </p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> I decided to try one really monstrous superlarge network,
  but the program coredumped!<br>
  <strong> A.</strong> Some of the parameters have hardcoded limits, as defined
  in <tt>sofmdefs.h</tt>. For example, there is a max network size, max number
  of snapshots, max number of input vectors. You can change these limits and
recompile. </p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> I've read this FAQ and my question
  was not listed in here!<br>
  <strong> A</strong>. Send your question to <a href="mailto:cs394n@utlists.utexas.edu">the class mailing list</a>.
  If describing a suspected software problem, be sure to
  include all relevant information, such as what machines you were using (both
  local <em>and</em> remote), and a sample transcript showing the unexpected behavior.</p>
