  <h1>Self-Organizing Maps and Learning Vector Quantization</h1>

  <p>An <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for this homework is now available. If you
    have questions and can&rsquo;t find an answer in it, please send an e-mail
     to <a href="mailto:houck@cs.utexas.edu?subject=CS 394N HW1">the
    TA</a> and cc Prof. Miikkulainen at risto@cs.utexas.edu.</p>

  <p>In this homework you will explore the capabilities and properties of
  self-organizing maps (SOM) and learning vector quantization (LVQ).  On a CS
    Linux machine, copy the entire contents of <tt>/u/www/users/risto/cs394n/private/hw1</tt> to
  your own directory and proceed.  
  <p>
<a href="part1a/Readme.html"><b>Part 1a: Peano approximation</b></a> Form a 
1-dimensional mapping of a uniform distribution on the 2-D unit square. 
To get a feel of the process and the parameters value, start with small 
maps (half a dozen units) and gradually work your way to larger maps 
(order of 10<sup>2</sup> units). How close to a Peano curve can you get? 
Are you convinced that it will actually get there if you keep adding units?

<p>
<a href="part1b/Readme.html"><b>Part 1b: Distribution</b></a>  Form a 
2-dimensional map of a nonuniform distribution on the 2-dimensional unit 
square, depicted below.  The x-component is normally distributed with 
mean = 0.5. The y-component is a combination of two normal distributions, 
with means at 0.25 and 0.75.  Again, start by experimenting with small maps, 
and after you have gained insight into the process, make the final mapping 
with a large network (10 by 10 to 10 by 20 units).   How well can the map 
approximate a nonuniform distribution? How many units would you need to
have to get a good approximation?

    <p><strong>Digit Recognition</strong> In the following parts
      you will explore the capability of SOM and LVQ on the task of digit recognition.
      You will have to design 8 by 8 bitmap representations for each digit of
      0 to 9, and concatenate the representations into 64-unit input vectors.
      Design 4-10 example patterns for each digit. Try to come up with a training
      set that would be likely to give good generalization to digits written
      in different styles, and also to noisy digits. You can use the X-window
      based pattern editor 
        <a href="digit/digit.cpp"><tt>digit.cpp</tt></a> to create your training
      patterns. The source code, precompiled executables for various platforms
        (.pc for x86 Linux) and instructions on how to use it are in <a href="digit/"><tt>digit</tt></a>.
        The program can store the digits in several different formats; in this
        homework you will be using the SNNS format (.pat files). </p>
    <p><strong>Test Patterns</strong> The test pattern
      file <a href="digit-test.pat"><tt>digit-test.pat</tt></a> contains several
      examples of inaccurate, noisy, distorted, and otherwise corrupted input
      patterns. The objective is to find out how well the network generalizes
      into real world data, such as the patterns from the <a href="nist.pat">NIST
      dataset</a>.
      Be sure you do not use any of the test patterns during training! Typically
      during testing, the output of the network is no longer a clear-cut classification
      as was the case for the training vectors. The output unit activities stand
      for the likelihoods of each classification. </p>

<a href="part2/Readme.html"><b>Part 2: Dimensionality reduction</b></a>  
Form a 2-d map of the 64-dimensional bitmap vectors that you designed.  In order
to properly separate the vectors on the map, you will need about four times more
units than you have vectors. Can you see a topological order on the map? What
relations are preserved and what are lost? Is it easy to draw the lines that
separate the classes? In case you have more examples of certain types of input
patterns, do you see a magnifying effect? When you are done with training/testing,
try add more training examples.  Do you get better performance? 
<p>
<a href="part3a/Readme.html"><b>Part 3a: Classification</b></a>  Label the 
units of the self-organizing map. Now use the test patterns from  
digit-test.pat as input:  how many of them are classified correctly?
<p>
<a href="part3b/Readme.html"><b>Part 3b: LVQ</b></a> Continue training the 
self-organizing map it with your labeled vectors using the LVQ method.  
How does the map change?  Test the classification again with the test 
input set. How does the performance compare to the self-organizing map of Part
3a?
(If not, why?)
<p>
<b>Tools:</b> The 
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/risto/cs394n/private/hw1/">
<tt>SOM/LVQ directory</tt></a> has subdirectories for each part of the 
assignment. They contain the appropriate self-organizing map and LVQ 
programs and example data files.  Copy these to your own working
directory.  Each directory also has a <tt>Readme</tt> file that explains 
how to get started.  There is also a 
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/risto/cs394n/private/hw1/hw1.tar.gz">
tar file</a> that contains everything, but you will have to make the 
appropriate changes if you run the program locally (for example, set 
XENVIRONMENT to your local copy of <tt>part1a/XFmrevised</tt> if you 
want to modify the resource file).  However, this really shouldn't be 
difficult.

<p>
<b>Report:</b> Write a one or two page report on the experiments you did,
and what you learned from them. Does the feature map architecture
deliver what the theory promises (magnification, Peano-approximation,
visualization, classification)? Does the LVQ improve classification
capabilities significantly?  Under what
conditions and tasks? Turn in the simulation files (including the final
snapshot only) with your report. Also include the final labeled maps
in parts 2 and 3.
