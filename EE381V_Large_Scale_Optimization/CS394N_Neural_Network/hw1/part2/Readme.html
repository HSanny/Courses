<h2>Part 2 Readme</h2>

<p>
In this part of the homework, you'll do the following:

<ol>
<li> Prepare your input files.
<ol>
<li>Create a  training example file (e.g. <tt>train.ex</tt>) by using the digit
  program. Run
  <blockquote>
<tt>digit train.pat</tt></blockquote> 
  Refer to digit.instructions for the usage of the program.  Note that your training examples should resemble handwritten numerals, they shouldn't all be perfectly neat.
<li> Generate a vector file and a label file by using the Perl script <tt>convert-digits.pl</tt>.
Run
  <blockquote><tt>./convert-digits.pl train.pat train.vectors train.labels</tt></blockquote>
</ol>
<li> Prepare your simulation file (for the purposes of this explanation, we'll
  assume it's called <tt>mysimu</tt>) using <a href="simu.demo"><tt>simu.demo</tt></a> as the 
  starting point:
  <ul>
   <li>  Do <tt>cp simu.demo mysimu</tt>.
   <li>In <tt>mysimu</tt>, remove everything below the snapshot definitions as in part1.
   <li> Set the <tt>vectorfilename</tt> parameter to whatever file you 
       created with the conversion script described above.
   <li> Change the network sizes (the nx and ny parameters), the
       learning rates and neighborhoods (see <a href="Readme.parameters">
       Readme.parameters</a> for details) as necessary to get a good mapping.
   <li> Change the tend parameter to however many epochs you want to train.
       At first it is a good idea to run it only for a few hundred
       epochs to get an idea how it is going to organize; after you are
       confident that the parameters are correct, you can run several thousand
       epochs in the background (see below).	
   <li> Change the snapshot definition so that it will match tend
       (so that the last snapshot will be saved).
   <li> Set the <tt>disp_rate</tt> parameter to 1 if you want the map 
       organization to be displayed every iteration, to 0 if you never 
       want it displayed, or to some other integer n if you want it 
       displayed every nth iteration.
</ul>
<li>  Edit <a href="sofm.tcl"><tt>sofm.tcl</tt></a> to change 
   <tt>set simufile "simu.demo"</tt> to <tt>set simufile "mysimu"</tt>.  (Note that if you are using your own Ubuntu machine you need <tt>tk8.5</tt> installed to run this, and you might need to change the first line of <tt> sofm.tcl</tt> to <tt>#!/usr/bin/wish8.5</tt>).  

<li> Exit and type <tt>./sofm.tcl</tt>  A <a href="images/sofm.gif">feature map window</a> will pop up.  Each unit 
   is represented by a box, and a label inside the box indicates that an input 
   vector with that label was mapped on that unit (i.e. it was the maximally 
   responding unit when that vector was presented as input).  Each unit may 
   have several labels.

<li> Eventually, once you get the hang of the process, you may want to
   run a long simulation in the background to save time (display at each
   epoch takes a lot of time). Set <tt>disp_rate</tt> to 0 during training,
   save snapshots at several iterations. After the training is done,
   set <tt>disp_rate</tt> to 1 in the simufile, type <tt>sofm.tcl</tt> 
   again, and the program displays the organization after each snapshot 
   you saved.  Alternatively, if your machine is fast enough that running 
   in the background is less important than just not having so much text 
   output, you could just set <tt>disp_rate</tt> to some reasonably large 
   value (e.g. 25) so that it only displays a few pictures over the course
   of the training.

<li> If the network does not look good, repeat steps 2-6 with different
   parameters until you are happy with it. Note that currently the
   largest netsize is 20x20; if you want to try larger nets, you have to
   change MAXNX and MAXNY in <a href="sofm.h">sofm.h</a> and
   recompile. 
</ol>

Here are more details for those interested:

*** Forming a 2-d topological feature map of n-d input vector data ***

<p>
<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>
This package contains the code and data for forming a 2-d (or 1-d)
feature map of n-dimensional vector data.

<h3>What does it do?</h3>

<p>
<ul>
  <li> 2-D (or 1-d) network with variable number of units in each dimension
  <li> Input vectors read from the file and cycled through
  <li> Random initial input weights
  <li> Response of a unit inversely proportional to the euclidian distance
     between the input vector and the weight vector of the unit
  <li> Global selection of maximally responding unit
  <li> Weights changed toward the input within a neighborhood of this unit
</ul>

<p>
The simulation consists of phases during which the neighborhood size and
learning rate are linearly decreased. Snapshots of the simulation can be
saved to a file and the simulation can be later continued by reading in
the current state of the network from the save file. Snapshots and
endpoints of phases are defined in epochs.

<p>
The display works through generic alphanumeric output. For each input
vector, the current maximally responding unit is shown. Graphics can
also be turned off and network can be developed as a background job,
saving snapshots along the way. When the save file is later read in
(with display on), the first input after the network has reached its
saved state is displayed.


<h3>What do I need to run it?</h3>

<p>
Files needed:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="simu.demo"><tt>simufile</tt></a>  simulation and network 
       configuration parameters and snapshots of the simulation (appended)
       see <a href="Readme.parameters">Readme.parameters</a> for explanation
  <li> <a href="demo.labels"><tt>labelfile</tt></a> contains the character 
       strings corresponding to vector names
  <li> <a href="demo.vectors"><tt>vectorfile</tt></a> the input vectors.
</ul>

<p>
The sample simufile contains 3 snapshots of a simulation where a sample 
set of 99 handwritten digit representations were mapped to a 13x13 map.  
To run it, type <tt>sofm.tcl</tt> (with "simufile" set to "simu.demo"), 
and hit return after each snapshot is displayed.
