<h2>Part 3a Readme</h2>

<p>
This part of the homework does not require any training, just running
the program in this directory with your data to check how well the
feature map you trained is performing in the classification task.

<ol>
<li> Copy your simulation file (e.g., <tt>mysimu</tt>) from part 2. If you saved
  multiple snapshots, edit the copy so that it only contains the last snapshot
  (See <a href="../part2/Readme.parameters">
part2/Readme.parameters</a> for details on the structure of the snapshot). 
The file <a href="simu.demo"><tt>simu.demo</tt></a> is an example of what 
it should look like.

<li> Copy your training vector and label files (e.g. <tt>train.vectors</tt>
  and <tt>train.labels</tt>) from part 2. 
<li>Edit <tt>sofm.tcl</tt> so that it will read <tt>mysimu</tt> (or whatever
  your simulation file) instead of <tt>simu.demo</tt>. 
<li> Type <tt>./sofm.tcl</tt>.  A <a href="images/sofm.gif">feature map window</a>
  will pop up, as in Part 2.
  Click on the STEP button once.
    <ul>
    <li> the centermost label in each box identifies the closest training 
    vector for that unit (i.e. the label of that vector in the training 
    vectorfile that is closest in Euclidean distance to the weight vector 
    of the unit).
    <li> the rest of the labels indicate where the testvectors were mapped.
    <li> classification performance is shown on the bottom left of the window 
  </ul>
<p>
If a testvector label is not the same as the label of the unit (i.e. the
centermost label in the box), that means the network classified it
incorrectly.
</ol>
