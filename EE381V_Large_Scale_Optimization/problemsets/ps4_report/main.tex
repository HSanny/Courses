{\bf Command} to be executed in matlab:
\begin{verbatim}
  >> x_init = [1 1]'; alpha = 0.3; bta = 0.8;
  >> [x, iter, all_costs] = gd_btls(x_init, @func, @func_grad, alpha, bta);
\end{verbatim}
{\bf Dump}
\begin{verbatim}
  Iter: 1, Cost: 5.292007e+00, Conv_Rate: 0.106142, gamma: 0.800000
  Iter: 44, Cost: 2.559267e+00, Conv_Rate: 1.000000, gamma: 0.000000
  Convergence reached!
