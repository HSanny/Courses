1. Assume you have a virtual memory system that uses paging. Is the system
vulnerable to internal and/or external fragmentation? Explain.

The system use paging mechanism will suffer from internal fragmentation. The
spatial overhead comes from the seperation of virtual space into fixed-sized
pieces. Such overhead will increase when the page size is large.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What is the difference between global and local page replacement policies?
Name a disadvantage of each.

Local replacement policy means that when no free page frames, the victim page
frames can only be the ones occupied by the same process.
Disadvantage is high page fault rate. The OS has to reload the pages being
swampped out before. 

Global replacement policy means that when no free page frames, the victim page
frames can be the ones occupied by the any other processes.

3. In some operating systems, I/O from/to disk is done directly to/from a buffer
in the user program's memory. The user program does a system call specifying
the address and length of the buffer (the length must be a multiple of the
disk record size).

The disk controller needs a physical memory address, not a virtual address.
Ben Bitdiddle proposes that when the user does a write system call, the
operating system should check that the user's virtual address is valid,
translate it into a physical address, and pass that address and the length
(also checked for validity) to the disk hardware.

This won't quite work. In no more than two sentences, what did Ben forget?

4. Disk requests come into the disk driver for tracks 10, 22, 20, 2, 40, 6, and
38, in that order. A seek takes 6 msec per track moved. How much seek time is
needed for the following scheduling algorithms?
    a) FIFO 
    b) SSTF 
    c) LOOK (SCAN, but doesn't move to the end) 
In all cases, the arm is initially at track 20, and you may assume that the
head is traveling towards higher numbers.

5. Adapted from Tannenbaum Chapter 5 Number 24.
The MegaGiga hard disk rotates at 5400 rpm with an arm seek time given by = 4
+ 0.05t msec, where t is the number of tracks the arm seeks. Assume a block
size of 512 bytes, and 1024 tracks with 512 sector/track. The disk controller
and DMA read or write data from/to disk at a rate of 4MB/sec. What is the
storage capacity of the disk?
