1. Some file allocation schemes limit the size of the file whether or not there
is enough space for a larger file. Which ones and why?

    Linked
    Direct
    Contiguous
    Multi-Level index
    Extents

2. Is it fundamentally necessary to store on disk the
information about the unallocated disk sectors? Explain
why.

3. John would like to append data to the file
/usr/john/classes/cs372/final\_study\_notes.txt. Assuming he has the correct
permissions, describe the steps the operating system would need to take to
append the data.

4. Pooh Software Ltd. is selling a file system that uses a UNIX-like file
system with multi-level indexing. For more reliability, the inode array is
actually replicated on the disk in two different places. The intent is that if
one or a group of sectors that are storing either replica of the array become
bad, the system can always recover from the replica. Discuss the effect of
having this replicated data structure on performance.

5. In Unix, the pipe(fd[0]) function call creates an I/O mechanism called a
pipe and returns two file descriptors, fd[0] and fd[1]. The files associated
with fd[0] and fd[1] are streams of data and are both opened for reading and
writing. Suppose pipe always returns the two lowest-numbered file descriptors
in the process's file descriptor table that are unused. Assume that initially
fdt[], the file descriptor table, has three open entries: fdt[0] is the
default input device, fdt[1] is the default output device and fdt[2] is the
default error output device; all other entries of the fdt are NULL. What does
the fdt look like after each of the five following commands is executed in
sequence by the process?

    1: pipe (&fd[0]);
    2: close(fd[0]);
    3: close(1);
    4: dup(fd[1]);
    5: close(fd[1]);

When might such a sequence of commands be useful?

You'll need to use the man pages for pipe, close, and dup
to answer this question.
