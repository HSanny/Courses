  <h1>Iterative Deepening A* Search<br> 
        (due Sep 17, 2013, 23:59pm)</h1> 
 
<P> 
In this assignment, you will be implementing the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) search algorithm in the OpenNERO platform. You'll use the existing implementations of Depth First Search (DFS) and A* search as starting points, and modify and extend them to implement IDA*. <a href="../slides/HeuristicSearch/idastar1.htm">IDA*</a> search is an informed search algorithm that uses the same heuristic-function strategy as A*, but follows a DFS approach and only keeps track of the most recent path, thus reducing the memory complexity of the algorithm. Additional info from the first version of the AIMA book is available <a href="text_1.jpg">here</a> and <a href="text_2.jpg">here</a>, with an algorithm <a href="algo.jpg">here</a>.

<P> 
 
<H2>The OpenNERO Platform</H2> 
<p>The following steps should help get you up and running in OpenNERO:

<OL>
  <LI>Either:
	<ul><li>Go to <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/public-labs">one of the public labs</a>. On Mac and Windows machines, you can install it as you would on your own own machine (next line).  Unfortunately the software is currently not working on the Linux lab machines.</li><li>Install it on your own machine by downloading one of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/opennero/downloads/list">prebuilt binaries</a></li><li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/opennero/wiki/BuildingOpenNero">Build OpenNERO</a> on your own machine using the source code.</li></ul></LI>
  <li>Read the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/opennero/wiki/SystemOverview">system overview</a> to understand the interaction between the platform and the AI agents.</li>
  <li>Look at the demos for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/opennero/wiki/BruteForceSearch">Brute Force</a> (uninformed) and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/opennero/wiki/HeuristicSearch">Heuristic</a> (informed) search.</li>
</OL>
</p>

<h2>Creating your agent</h2>
<p>
To create your IDA* agent, open the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/opennero/source/browse/trunk/mods/Maze/agent.py">agent.py</a> file (located in <tt>trunk/mods/Maze</tt>). Notice that there are several agents implemented here, including a DFS agent (<tt>DFSSearchAgent</tt>) and an A* agent (<tt>AStarSearchAgent</tt>).</p>

<h3>Agent class</h3>
<p>Create a new class called IdaStarAgent with the same code as below:
</p>

<pre>
class IdaStarSearchAgent(SearchAgent):
    """
    IDA* algorithm
    """
    def __init__(self):
        # this line is crucial, otherwise the class is not recognized as an AgentBrainPtr by C++
        SearchAgent.__init__(self)

    def initialize(self, init_info):
        """
        Initializes the agent upon reset
        """

    def start(self, time, observations):
        """
        Called on the first move
        """
    
    def act(self, time, observations, reward):
        """
        Called every time the agent needs to take an action
        """

    def end(self, time, reward):
        """
        at the end of an episode, the environment tells us the final reward
        """
        print  "Final reward: %f, cumulative: %f" % (reward[0], self.fitness[0])
        self.reset()
        return True

    def destroy(self):
        """
        After one or more episodes, this agent can be disposed of
        """
        return True
</pre>

<p>Your agent is operating in a 2-D maze and is capable of moving from cell to cell. In the <tt>start</tt> and <tt>act</tt> methods, your agent receives a collection of <tt>observations</tt> about the world:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>observations[0]</tt> &ndash; The current row position of your agent.</li>
<li><tt>observations[1]</tt> &ndash; The current column position of your agent.</li>
<li><tt>observations[2]</tt> &ndash; 1 if there is an obstacle in the row above your position, otherwise 0.</li>
<li><tt>observations[3]</tt> &ndash; 1 if there is an obstacle in the row below your position, otherwise 0.</li>
<li><tt>observations[4]</tt> &ndash; 1 if there is an obstacle in the column to the right of your position, otherwise 0.</li>
<li><tt>observations[5]</tt> &ndash; 1 if there is an obstacle in the column to the left of your position, otherwise 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these methods, you are required to return an <tt>action</tt> &ndash; an integer corresponding to the desired move:
<ul>
<li>0 &ndash; Move to the row above. <tt>(row, column) &rarr; (row + 1, column)</tt></li>
<li>1 &ndash; Move to the row below. <tt>(row, column) &rarr; (row - 1, column)</tt></li>
<li>2 &ndash; Move to the column to the right. <tt>(row, column) &rarr; (row, column + 1)</tt></li>
<li>3 &ndash; Move to the column to the left. <tt>(row, column) &rarr; (row, column - 1)</tt></li>
<li>4 &ndash; Do nothing.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The class above is an empty skeleton. Refer to the other agent implementations in <tt>agent.py</tt> for guidance on how to implement in your agent. 
</p>

<h3>Configuration file</h3>
<p>Once you've created your agent, you'll need to add it to the configuration file for the OpenNERO maze mod. To do this, locate the SydneyAStar.xml file (<tt>Maze/data/shapes/character/SydneyAStar.xml</tt>) and change the following line:

<pre>
&lt;Python agent=&quot;Maze.agent.AStarSearchAgent()&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

to:
<pre>
&lt;Python agent=&quot;Maze.agent.IdaStarSearchAgent()&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

Once you've configured this line, pressing the <tt>Single Agent A*</tt> button in the Maze mod will run your agent.

<h3>Debugging</h3>
If you run into any bugs in your program, you can find the error log file for OpenNERO at one of the following locations:

<ul>
<li><b>Linux or Mac:</b> <tt>~/.opennero/nero_log.txt</tt></li>
<li><b>Windows:</b> <tt>"AppData\Local\OpenNERO\nero_log.txt"</tt> or <tt>"Local Settings\Application Data\OpenNERO\nero_log.txt"</tt> depending on the version of Windows you have.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Turning in your work</H2>
Turn your report, your agent.py file and a brief summary report electronically using <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/risto/cs343/turnin.html"><TT>turnin</TT></A> (grader: <TT>houck</TT>, homework: <TT>cs343-hw1</TT>). In your report, include any instructions needed to run your agent, as well as a brief description of how your agent implements IDA*. As mentioned before, it's easiest to just "tar" the directory and submit the tar-file to <TT>turnin</TT>.
