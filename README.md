USAGE:
---------------

To better test our implementation, we design a series of new tests based on given system requirement and **pass all of them in our own machine**. The series of tests are 

    TODO: add test

To run the sample tests, replace test_name with the name of the test and execute the following command:

    TODO: add command
	
An alternative is that you can use the RUN script designed by us, the usage is as follows:


or you can run all tests by simply typing:


If your output matches the solution, NOTHING will be printed. Otherwise the lines that differ will be shown. 
The output for the run of the test will also be stored in a file temp_output after running the second command.
