The definition of Turing Test proposed in 1.1.1 may not be logically sound, in
the sense that a human interrogator's "cannot tell whether the written
response come from a person or a computer" could be attributable to
individual identificaiton weakness.

In practice, it would be tremendously challenging to achieve the pure
rationality, which means a globally optimal decision. The challenge exists in
the complexity of objective function. Generally speaking, the objective
function may not be uni-modal, and thus, common numerical optimization methods
can only guarantee a local optima with efficiency.
