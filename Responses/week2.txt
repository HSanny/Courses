Search refers to the process of looking for a sequence of actions that reaches
the goal. The search takes an environment as input and output a solution, that
is, a sequence of actions. After the solution is figured out, the agent can
execute the computed solution and apply changes on environment to derive
expected optimal objective.

An open-loop agent ignores its perception from environment since it knows
the outcome of each-step behavior in advance. 

Before solving the real-world problem, we can exploit suitable methods on
corresponding toy problem for experimentation. 

In the area of AI, complete definition of a problem is supposed to include th
e followings:
    States, Initial States, Transition Model, Goal Test, Path Cost.

Four problem-solving performance:
    Completeness, Optimality, Time Complexity, Space Complexity

We already have knowledge about two uninformed search:  the breadth first
search and depth first search. BFS first considers the completeness of
searching at each level, whereas DFS first takes depth of searching into
account. 

Is there any particular search mixing both types of search method, in which
the degree of mixture can be human-specified? In fact, Uniform-cost search and
depth-limited search can be regarded as mixed methods, but these two searching
methods based on different strategies.

Response to exercise 3.1 
Explain why problem formulation must follow goal formulation.

As we all know, Goal formulation, based on the current situation and the
agent’s performance measure, is the first step in problem solving.
Problem formulation is the process of deciding what actions and states to
consider, given a goal.
Only when a goal is settled, the problem can be well formulated since the
actions and states to be considered by that.

Readings: due Thursday 1/23 (email response due Wed 1/22 by 8 pm)

Textbook - rest of Chapter 3
Append to your response a solution to at least one exercise from the end of
the chapter.
===========================================================

Heuristic search is one of informed searching method, which based itself on an
evaluation function h(n). 

Ways of informed search: 
    - best-first search
    - greedy best-first search
    - A* search
    - Recursive best-first search
Each searching method based itself on different evaluation function and
searching scheme.

Greedy best-first search trys to expand the node that is
closest to the goal, since this is the way to lead to a quick solution.

Strategies that know whether one non-goal state is “more promising” than
another are called informed search or heuristic search strategies.

The tree-search version of A∗ is optimal if h(n) is admissible, while the
graph-search version is optimal if h(n) is consistent.

A problem with fewer restrictions on the actions is called a relaxed problem.
The state-space graph of the relaxed problem is a supergraph of the original
state space because the removal of restrictions creates added edges in the
graph.

The cost of an optimal solution to a relaxed problem is an admissible
heuristic for the original problem.

The performance of heuristic search algorithms depends on the quality of the
heuristic function.

Response to exercise 3.11
What’s the difference between a world state, a state description, and a search
node? Why is this distinction useful?

A world state is how reality is. (objective) 
A state description is an agent’s internal description of a world state.
(machine's subjective opinion, may be lossy)

Because the agent might want to peceive things that are not true from the
environment, but it just imagines that it is true. And besides, the agent cares
about the real state of world but not its internal representation of it.
