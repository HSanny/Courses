Search refers to the process of looking for a sequence of actions that reaches
the goal. The search takes an environment as input and output a solution, that
is, a sequence of actions. After the solution is figured out, the agent can
execute the computed solution and apply changes on environment to derive
expected optimal objective.

An open-loop agent ignores its perception from environment since it knows
the outcome of each-step behavior in advance. 

Before solving the real-world problem, we can exploit suitable methods on
corresponding toy problem for experimentation. 

In the area of AI, complete definition of a problem is supposed to include th
e followings:
    States, Initial States, Transition Model, Goal Test, Path Cost.

We already have knowledge about two uninformed search:  the breadth first
search and depth first search. BFS first considers the completeness of
searching at each level, whereas DFS first takes depth of searching into
account. 

Is there any particular search mixing both types of search method, in which
the degree of mixture can be human-specified? In fact, Uniform-cost search and
depth-limited search can be regarded as mixed methods, but these two searching
methods based on different strategies.
