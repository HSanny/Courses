Append to your response a solution to exercise 4.1

=================================================================

1. Local search:
    definition:
        operation only involves in current state and successor
    advantage: 
        little memory required
        find reasonable solution in a large system

2. Hill-Climbing Algorithm
    problem encountered:
        local maxima
        ridge
        plateaux
    several variants: 
        stochastic hill climbing;
        first-choice hill climbing;
        random-restart hill climbing;

3. Simulated Annealing: 
    accept progress with certainty
    accept downhill with a probability less than 1
    with possibility to escape local optima

4. Local beam search:
    different from k random restart hill-climbing algorithm
    useful information are passed to different threads (share info)
    abandom unfruitful search and move computational resource to the
      unexplored place
    variant:
        stochastic beam search;

5. Genetic algorithm
    procedure:
        initial: randomly generate some states
        fitness function: evaluate the goodness of random states
        mutual selection: choose pair
        crossover: exchange partial information between mates
        random mutation
    primary advantage comes from crossover
    success highly depends on representation engineering
