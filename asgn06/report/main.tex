\section{Exercise 2}
\ovalbox{
\begin{minipage}{16cm} 
Consider an iteration of Algorithm A on a configuration $G = (U,V,E)$ that
increments the price of an item due to a violation of Stability Condition 2.
Assume that the MCM M of G associated with this execution of Algorithm A is an
MWMCM of $G$. Let $p (resp., p_0)$ denote the price vector of G maintained by
Algorithm A just before (resp., after) this iteration. Prove that if $P_0(G,p)$
holds, then so does $P_0(G,p_0)$. Hint: Make use of Lemma 1 of Assignment 4.

\section{Exercise 5}
\ovalbox{
\begin{minipage}{17cm}
    Consider an execution of Algorithm A on a configuration $G = (U,V,E)$.
    Assume that the associated MCM $M$ of $G$ is an MWMCM of $G$, and that the
    initial price vector $p$ for $G$ is such that $\Pt$ holds. Prove that
    Algorithm $A$ is guaranteed to halt successfully within a finite number of
    iterations. Hint: Make use of Lemma 3.
