    Let $i$, $j$, and $k$ be distinct integers in $[n]$ such that $j$ lies
    between $i$ and $k$, i.e., either $i < j < k$ and $k < j < i$. Assume that 
    bids $\alpha(i)$ and $\alpha(j)$ are linear. Prove that if $gap(p,i,j) =
    0$ and $\gjk = 0$, then $\gij = 0$.
\end{minipage} } \\[0.5cm]

Based on the known condition as follows, 
\begin{align}
    \gapij = 0 \\
    \gapjk = 0
\end{align}

And the assumed condition that 
\begin{align}
    i,j,k \in [n] \\
    \al{j} \text{ is linear}  \\
    \al{i} \text{ is linear} 
\end{align}

We have 
\begin{align}
    max(0, \s{i} \cdot \gij - \fpij) = 0 \\
    max(0, \s{j} \cdot \gjk - \fpjk) = 0
\end{align}

That is, 
\begin{align}
    \s{i} \cdot \gij - \fpij \leq 0 \label{1.1.A} \\
    \s{j} \cdot \gjk - \fpjk \leq 0 \label{1.1.B}
\end{align}

We sum up \eqref{1.1.A} and \eqref{1.1.B}, then get
\begin{align}
    \s{i} \cdot \gij - \fpij + \s{j} \cdot \gjk - \fpjk \leq 0 
\end{align}

This can be simplified to be 

\begin{align}
    \s{i} \cdot \gik - \fpik \leq  \gjk \cdot (\s{i} - \s{j})  
\end{align}

According to the known condition, we have
\begin{align}
    i < j < k \ \text{or }  k < j < i 
\end{align}

In the case of $i < j < k$, we have $\gjk = \qk - \qj \geq 0$ and 
$\s{i} - \s{j} \leq 0$ since $\al{i}$ and $\al{j}$ are matched to $\beta{i}$ and
$\beta{j}$ in MWMCM $M$, respectively. Similarly, in the case of $k < j < i$,
we have $\gij = \qj - \qi \leq 0$ and $\s{i} - \s{j} \geq 0$.
Therefore, it can be concluded that in either case, 
\begin{align}
    \gjk \cdot (\s{i} - \s{j}) \leq 0
\end{align}

Hence, we have 
\begin{align}
    \s{i} \cdot \gik - \fpik \leq  \gjk \leq 0
\end{align}

Since $\al{i}$ is linear bid and $i \in [n]$
\begin{align}
    \gapik = 0
\end{align}
