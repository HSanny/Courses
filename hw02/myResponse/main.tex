\section{Data Transformation and Normalization}
\subsection{Transformation}

\end{figure}

where each document vector (column) correponds to the frequency of terms 
$$ (business, computer, economy, growth, operating, recession, recovery,
released, software, system, virus) $$
and each term vector (row) represents term frequency in documents
$$ 
(c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, m6, m7, m8, m9, m10)
$$

\subsection{Normalization}

\section{Cosine Similarity}
We compute the $B^T B$ and get the following result,

\begin{figure}[h]

Note that each entry $e_{ij}$ represents the cosine similarity between
document $i$ and document $j$.
