For debugging, see the Execution logs in Appendix \ref{AppdendixB}.

\section{Report optimal $\lambda$}
The optimal lambda derived is $\lambda = 1$.

\section{Problem when $\lambda = 0$}
The problem encountered when $\lambda = 0$ is that the singularity of
$\ukt * \uk$ and $\mkt * \mk$.


\section{RMSE of Test Set under optimal $\lambda$}
The RMSE of test set under optimal $\lambda = $ is $1.0835$.
