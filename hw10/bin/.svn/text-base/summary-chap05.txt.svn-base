Hardware Description Language

Synthesis This chapter investigates the use of Java as a Hardware
Description Language (HDL). The program simulates a typical computer
that adopts the Von Neumann architecture. The basic components are the
RAM memory that stores the programs and the data, the Keyboard that reads
input data from the command-line, the Monitor that displays the results,
the CPU that process the elementary operations (load, store, add, jump,
etc.), and the Bus that interconnects the basic components. Focus: this
case study exemplifies the exchange of data between objects and the use
of state transition diagrams to describe the behaviour of the CPU. OO
techniques: inclusion. Java features: Vectors, Files. Background: the
reader is required to know the basic OO concepts and fundamental Java
programming techniques.
